### Description

You are given a string `s` consisting only of uppercase English letters.

You can apply some operations to this string where, in one operation, you can remove any occurrence of one of the substrings `"AB"` or `"CD"` from `s`.

Return _the minimum possible length of the resulting string that you can obtain_.

Note that the string concatenates after removing the substring and could produce new `"AB"` or `"CD"` substrings.

**Example 1:**

```cpp
Input: s = "ABFCACDB"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Remove the substring "ABFCACDB", so s = "FCACDB".
- Remove the substring "FCACDB", so s = "FCAB".
- Remove the substring "FCAB", so s = "FC".
So the resulting length of the string is 2.
It can be shown that it is the minimum length that we can obtain.
```

**Example 2:**

```cpp
Input: s = "ACBBD"
Output: 5
Explanation: We cannot do any operations on the string so the length remains the same.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists only of uppercase English letters.

### Approach 1: String Replace

#### Intuition

The core issue with this problem is the ripple effect of removing substrings. When we delete one occurrence of "AB" or "CD", it can create another substring that also needs removal. For example, in "CABD", if we remove "AB", we are left with "CD", which must also be eliminated to minimize the string length.

A brute force approach will be to continuously check the string for "AB" and "CD" and remove them until none are left. Once the loop ends, the string will have no remaining "AB" or "CD", and we can return its length. Many programming languages offer built-in functions for finding and removing substrings, which will be helpful here.

> Note: Some programming practices suggest avoiding direct modifications to input data. If this applies, consider making a copy of the input string before you start. It’s a good idea to clarify this with your interviewer before you implement the solution.

#### Algorithm

- Enter a loop that continues while `s` contains either "AB" or "CD".
    - Check if `s` contains "AB":
        - If "AB" is present, remove all occurrences of "AB" from `s`.
    - If "AB" is not present, check if `s` contains "CD".
        - If "CD" is present, remove all occurrences of "CD" from `s`.
- After the loop ends, return the length of `s`.

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minLength(string s) {
        // Continue processing while "AB" or "CD" substrings exist
        while (s.find("AB") != -1 || s.find("CD") != -1) {
            if (s.find("AB") != -1) {
                // Remove all occurrences of "AB"
                s.erase(s.find("AB"), 2);
            } else if (s.find("CD") != -1) {
                // Remove all occurrences of "CD"
                s.erase(s.find("CD"), 2);
            }
        }

        return s.length();
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of the input string `s`.

- Time complexity: O(n^2)
    
    The outer while loop can run up to n/2 times in the worst case. This occurs when we remove two characters in each iteration (e.g., for a string like "ABABABAB"). Inside the loop, the string methods need to scan the entire string, which takes O(n) time.
    
    Thus, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n/2⋅n)=O(n^2).
    
- Space complexity: O(n) for Python3 and Java, O(1) for C++
    
    In Python3 and Java, strings are immutable. So, each string operation creates a new string object. However, at any given time, we only need to store one version of the processed string. So, the space complexity is O(n).
    
    However, in C++, strings are mutable. So, string operations like `erase()` are performed in place. Thus, the space complexity in C++ is O(1).

### Approach 2: Stack

#### Intuition

In the string removal process, we face two choices for each character:

1. Keep the character if it does not form a removable pattern.
2. Remove it along with the previous character if it completes a pattern.

Using a stack simplifies this task. We push characters onto the stack as we read them and pop them off when we find a pattern.

We read the input string from left to right. For each character, we decide to either add it to the stack or remove a previous character. If the stack is not empty, we compare the current character with the top character on the stack. If they form "AB" or "CD," we pop the stack. We do not push the current character, thus removing both characters. If there is no pattern, we push the current character onto the stack.

After processing all characters, the remaining elements in the stack represent the minimum length of the string after all possible removals.

#### Algorithm

- Initialize a stack to store the characters from the string.
- Iterate over each character in the input string `s`. For each character `currentChar`:
    - If the stack is empty, push `currentChar` onto the stack and continue to the next character.
    - If the current character is 'B' and the top of the stack is 'A', remove the top element from the stack.
    - If the current character is 'D' and the top of the stack is 'C', remove the top element from the stack.
    - If neither of the above conditions is met, push `currentChar` onto the stack.
- After processing all characters, return the size of the stack.

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minLength(string s) {
        stack<char> stack;

        // Iterate over each character in the input string
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char currentChar = s[i];

            // If the stack is empty, simply push the current character
            if (stack.empty()) {
                stack.push(currentChar);
                continue;
            }

            // Check for "AB" pattern, remove the pair by popping from the stack
            if (currentChar == 'B' && stack.top() == 'A') {
                stack.pop();
            }
            // Check for "CD" pattern, remove the pair by popping from the stack
            else if (currentChar == 'D' && stack.top() == 'C') {
                stack.pop();
            }
            // Otherwise, push the current character onto the stack
            else {
                stack.push(currentChar);
            }
        }

        return stack.size();
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of the input string `s`.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    We iterate over each character of `s` exactly once. All stack operations inside the loop take constant time. Thus, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(n).
    
- Space complexity: O(n)
    
    We use a stack to store characters from the input string. In the worst-case scenario, where no "AB" or "CD" patterns are found, we would end up storing all n characters in the stack. Thus, the space complexity of the algorithm is O(n).

### Approach 3: In Place Modification

#### Intuition

To optimize space, we can modify the string in place.

We use two pointers:

1. Read Pointer (`readPtr`): This pointer moves from left to right through the string, checking each character.
2. Write Pointer (`writePtr`): This pointer tracks where to write the next character we want to keep.

We start by setting `writePtr` to 0. As we move `readPtr` through the string, we copy the character at `readPtr` to the position indicated by `writePtr`. Next, we check if the last two characters (positions `writePtr-1` and `writePtr`) form a removable pattern, such as "AB" or "CD". If they do, we decrease `writePtr`, which means we will overwrite this part in the next steps.

If the last two characters do not form a removable pattern, we increment `writePtr` to point to the next position where we can write a character. This way, we can effectively "remove" unwanted characters by overwriting them.

After processing all characters, the position of `writePtr` tells us the length of the final string. All the characters we want to keep are now at the beginning of the array, up to the position of `writePtr`.

#### Algorithm

- Initialize a variable `writePtr` to 0, which will keep track of the current write position.
- Iterate over each character in the string using a `readPtr`:
    - Copy the character at `readPtr` to the position at `writePtr` in the string.
    - Check if the following conditions are met:
        - `writePtr` is greater than 0 (ensuring there's a previous character).
        - The previous character (at `writePtr - 1`) is either 'A' or 'C'.
        - The current character is exactly one ASCII value higher than the previous character.
    - If these conditions are met:
        - Decrement `writePtr` by 1, effectively removing the pair of characters.
    - Else:
        - Increment `writePtr` by 1, moving to the next position for writing.
- Return the value of `writePtr`, which represents the length of the remaining string after all removals.

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minLength(string s) {
        int writePtr = 0;
        vector<char> charArray(s.begin(), s.end());

        // Iterate over each character in the string
        for (int readPtr = 0; readPtr < s.length(); readPtr++) {
            // Write the current character to the current write position
            charArray[writePtr] = charArray[readPtr];

            // Check if we have a valid pattern to remove
            if (writePtr > 0 &&
                (charArray[writePtr - 1] == 'A' ||
                 charArray[writePtr - 1] == 'C') &&
                charArray[writePtr] == charArray[writePtr - 1] + 1) {
                writePtr--;
            } else {
                writePtr++;  // No match, so move the write pointer forward
            }
        }

        // The writePtr now represents the length of the remaining string
        return writePtr;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of the input string `s`.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    We iterate through the input string exactly once. All operations within the loop take constant time. Thus, the overall time complexity is linear, O(n).
    
- Space complexity: O(n) for Java and Python3, O(1) for C++
    
    In Java and Python3, strings are immutable. So, the input string needs to be converted to an array or list to perform in place modifications. Thus, the space complexity remains O(n).
    
    String are mutable in C++. So, all modifications can be done on the input string itself. No additional data structures are used, so the space complexity is O(1).
