### Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, replace the value of each node in the tree with the **sum of all its cousins' values**.

Two nodes of a binary tree are **cousins** if they have the same depth with different parents.

Return _the_ `root` _of the modified tree_.

**Note** that the depth of a node is the number of edges in the path from the root node to it.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/01/11/example11.png)

```cpp
Input: root = [5,4,9,1,10,null,7]
Output: [0,0,0,7,7,null,11]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial binary tree and the binary tree after changing the value of each node.
- Node with value 5 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 4 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 9 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 1 has a cousin with value 7 so its sum is 7.
- Node with value 10 has a cousin with value 7 so its sum is 7.
- Node with value 7 has cousins with values 1 and 10 so its sum is 11.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/01/11/diagram33.png)

```cpp
Input: root = [3,1,2]
Output: [0,0,0]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial binary tree and the binary tree after changing the value of each node.
- Node with value 3 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 1 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 2 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^4`

### Approach 1: Two Pass BFS

#### Intuition

Cousins are nodes that share the same depth but have different parents. This means that to find the sum of a node’s cousins, we first need to know the total sum of all nodes at the same depth. If we subtract the sum of a node and its siblings from this total, we’re left with the sum of its cousins.

![2641_cousins_II](https://leetcode.com/problems/cousins-in-binary-tree-ii/Figures/2641/2641_cousins_II.png)

With this thought in mind, we break down the solution into two parts. First, we perform a BFS traversal to calculate the sum of all nodes at each level. In BFS, we explore each level independently, which lets us sum the node values for each level as we go. We store these sums in an array, `levelSums`, so each level’s total is recorded and ready for the next part.

In the second part, we go through the tree again with another BFS traversal. Now, as we visit each node, we use the `levelSums` array recorded earlier. For each node, we subtract the value of itself and its sibling from the corresponding `levelSums` entry. The remaining sum is the cousin sum, which we then assign to the current node.

#### Algorithm

- If the `root` is null, return `root`.
    
- Initialize a queue `nodeQueue` and push `root` into it.
    
- Create an array `levelSums` to store the sum of node values at each level.
    
- First BFS traversal to calculate the sum of nodes at each level:
    
    - While the queue is not empty:
        - Initialize `levelSum` to `0` for the current level.
        - Get the number of nodes at the current level (`levelSize`).
        - For each node at this level:
            - Pop the front node from the queue and add its value to `levelSum`.
            - If the node has a left child, push it to the queue.
            - If the node has a right child, push it to the queue.
        - After processing all nodes at the level, append `levelSum` to `levelSums`.
- Second BFS traversal to update each node's value to the sum of its cousins:
    
    - Push `root` back into the queue.
        
    - Set `root.val` to `0` since it has no cousins.
        
    - Initialize `levelIndex` to `1`.
        
    - While the queue is not empty:
        
        - Get the number of nodes at the current level (`levelSize`).
        - For each node at this level:
            - Pop the front node from the queue.
            - Calculate `siblingSum` by adding the values of the left and right children (if they exist).
            - If the left child exists, update its value to `levelSums[levelIndex] - siblingSum` and push it to the queue.
            - If the right child exists, update its value similarly and push it to the queue.
        - Increment `levelIndex` after processing the current level.
- Return the modified `root` of the tree.
    

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* replaceValueInTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return root;

        queue<TreeNode*> nodeQueue;
        nodeQueue.push(root);
        vector<int> levelSums;

        // First BFS: Calculate sum of nodes at each level
        while (!nodeQueue.empty()) {
            int levelSum = 0;
            int levelSize = nodeQueue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; ++i) {
                TreeNode* currentNode = nodeQueue.front();
                nodeQueue.pop();
                levelSum += currentNode->val;
                if (currentNode->left) nodeQueue.push(currentNode->left);
                if (currentNode->right) nodeQueue.push(currentNode->right);
            }
            levelSums.push_back(levelSum);
        }

        // Second BFS: Update each node's value to sum of its cousins
        nodeQueue.push(root);
        int levelIndex = 1;
        root->val = 0;  // Root has no cousins
        while (!nodeQueue.empty()) {
            int levelSize = nodeQueue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; ++i) {
                TreeNode* currentNode = nodeQueue.front();
                nodeQueue.pop();

                int siblingSum =
                    (currentNode->left ? currentNode->left->val : 0) +
                    (currentNode->right ? currentNode->right->val : 0);

                if (currentNode->left) {
                    currentNode->left->val = levelSums[levelIndex] - siblingSum;
                    nodeQueue.push(currentNode->left);
                }
                if (currentNode->right) {
                    currentNode->right->val =
                        levelSums[levelIndex] - siblingSum;
                    nodeQueue.push(currentNode->right);
                }
            }
            ++levelIndex;
        }

        return root;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of nodes in the tree.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    In the first BFS, we traverse each node in the tree once to calculate the sum of values at each level. This requires visiting each of the n nodes, leading to a time complexity of O(n). Similarly, the second BFS traverses each node to update its value based on the sums of its cousins, which also takes O(n) time. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n)+O(n)=O(n).
    
- Space complexity: O(n)
    
    The space complexity primarily comes from the queue used in the BFS and the array that stores the level sums. The maximum size of the queue will be the maximum width of the tree, which in the worst case (for a complete binary tree) can be O(n). Additionally, the `levelSums` array will store one integer for each level of the tree. In a balanced binary tree, the height is O(logn), leading to O(logn) levels. However, in the worst case, we can have O(n) elements in `levelSums` when considering unbalanced trees (e.g., all nodes have only one child). Thus, the overall space complexity can be represented as O(n).

### Approach 2: Two Pass DFS

#### Intuition

We can apply the same approach in DFS as we did in BFS. We begin with a DFS traversal to calculate the sum of the values of all nodes at each depth level. We define an array called `levelSums`, where each index corresponds to a specific level in the tree. As we traverse, we add each node's value to the appropriate index in `levelSums`.

Next, we proceed with the second DFS traversal to update each node's values. In this traversal, we calculate each node's left and right children’s values, defaulting to zero if they are absent. If the node is at the root level or the first level, we set its value to zero since these nodes do not have cousins.

For deeper nodes, we compute their new value as the sum from `levelSums` at their level, subtracting their current value and the sum of their siblings.

#### Algorithm

- Declare an array `levelSums` to store the sum of values at each level of the tree.
    
- Define the `replaceValueInTree` function:
    
    - Call `calculateLevelSum(root, 0)` to perform a depth-first search (DFS) and calculate the sum of values at each level.
    - Call `replaceValueInTreeInternal(root, 0, 0)` to replace each node's value with the sum of its cousins.
    - Return the modified tree root.
- Define the `calculateLevelSum` function:
    
    - If `node` is `null`, return (base case).
    - Add the value of `node` to `levelSums[level]` (accumulate the sum at the current level).
    - Recursively call `calculateLevelSum` for the left child, increasing the level by 1.
    - Recursively call `calculateLevelSum` for the right child, increasing the level by 1.
- Define the `replaceValueInTreeInternal` function:
    
    - If `node` is `null`, return (base case).
        
    - Determine the values of the left and right children:
        
        - If `node.left` is `null`, set `leftChildVal` to 0; otherwise, set it to `node.left.val`.
        - If `node.right` is `null`, set `rightChildVal` to 0; otherwise, set it to `node.right.val`.
    - For the root and its children (level 0 and level 1):
        
        - Set `node.val` to 0.
    - For other levels:
        
        - Set `node.val` to `levelSums[level] - node.val - siblingSum` (sum of cousins).
    - Recursively call `replaceValueInTreeInternal` for the left child, passing the right child's value as the sibling sum and increasing the level by 1.
        
    - Recursively call `replaceValueInTreeInternal` for the right child, passing the left child's value as the sibling sum and increasing the level by 1.
        

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    // Array to store the sum of values at each level
    int levelSums[100000];

public:
    TreeNode* replaceValueInTree(TreeNode* root) {
        calculateLevelSum(root, 0);              // First pass to calculate sums
        replaceValueInTreeInternal(root, 0, 0);  // Second pass to update values
        return root;
    }

    // First DFS to calculate the sum of values at each level
    void calculateLevelSum(TreeNode* node, int level) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return;
        }

        levelSums[level] += node->val;  // Accumulate sum at the current level
        calculateLevelSum(node->left, level + 1);   // Recur for the left child
        calculateLevelSum(node->right, level + 1);  // Recur for the right child
    }

    // Second DFS to replace each node's value with the sum of its cousins
    void replaceValueInTreeInternal(TreeNode* node, int siblingSum, int level) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return;
        }

        // Left child value
        int leftChildVal = node->left == nullptr ? 0 : node->left->val;
        // Right child value
        int rightChildVal = node->right == nullptr ? 0 : node->right->val;

        // For the root and its children, set value to 0
        if (level == 0 || level == 1) {
            node->val = 0;
        } else {
            // Set the node's value to the sum of its cousins
            node->val = levelSums[level] - node->val - siblingSum;
        }

        // Recur for left and right children
        replaceValueInTreeInternal(node->left, rightChildVal, level + 1);
        replaceValueInTreeInternal(node->right, leftChildVal, level + 1);
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of nodes in the tree.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    In the first DFS traversal, we visit each node exactly once to compute the sum of values at each level. Thus, this part has a time complexity of O(n). In the second DFS, we again traverse each node exactly once to update the values based on the previously computed sums. Therefore, this part also has a time complexity of O(n).
    
    Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n)+O(n)=O(n).
    
- Space complexity: O(n)
    
    The maximum depth of the recursion stack will be equal to the height of the tree, which is O(h). In a balanced binary tree, h is O(logn), while in the worst case (for a skewed tree), h can be O(n).
    
    The `levelSums` array is determined by the maximum number of levels in the tree, which can be at most n. Thus, the overall space complexity can be represented as O(n).

### Approach 3: Single BFS with Running Sum

#### Intuition

We can aim to reduce our two-step process into a single traversal. So the question is: can we calculate the level sums and update the nodes’ values simultaneously? With some adjustments, it’s possible. Instead of storing each level’s sum first and revisiting it later, we calculate the cousin sum as we traverse each level and apply it immediately.

We start by initializing a `previousLevelSum` variable with the root node’s value, as this is the sum we’ll use for the next level’s nodes. During the traversal, as we visit each node, we subtract its value from `previousLevelSum` and set this as its new value, which gives us the sum of the other nodes at the same level. Then, we calculate the sum of this node’s children (or siblings if it has one). We push each child into the queue for the next level, using this sibling sum to update each child’s value as we move forward. This allows us to maintain a running sum that serves as the cousin sum for the next level.

#### Algorithm

- If `root` is null, return `root` immediately (base case).
    
- Initialize a queue `nodeQueue` to perform level-order traversal and add `root` to it.
    
- Set `previousLevelSum` to the value of `root` (since initially the sum of the previous level is the root value).
    
- While `nodeQueue` is not empty (meaning there are nodes to process at the current level):
    
    - Get the number of nodes in the current level (`levelSize`).
        
    - Set `currentLevelSum` to 0, which will store the sum of the current level's values.
        
    - For each node in the current level:
        
        - Dequeue the node from `nodeQueue`.
            
        - Update the current node's value to the "cousin sum" by subtracting the current node's value from `previousLevelSum`.
            
        - Calculate the "sibling sum", which is the sum of the values of the current node's left and right children (if they exist).
            
        - If the current node has a left child:
            
            - Add the left child's value to `currentLevelSum`.
            - Update the left child's value to `siblingSum`.
            - Add the left child to `nodeQueue` to process it in the next iteration (next level).
        - If the current node has a right child:
            
            - Add the right child's value to `currentLevelSum`.
            - Update the right child's value to `siblingSum`.
            - Add the right child to `nodeQueue` to process it in the next iteration (next level).
    - After processing the current level, update `previousLevelSum` to the value of `currentLevelSum` for use in the next iteration.
        
- Return the modified `root`.

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* replaceValueInTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return root;
        }

        queue<TreeNode*> nodeQueue;
        nodeQueue.push(root);
        int previousLevelSum = root->val;

        while (!nodeQueue.empty()) {
            int levelSize = nodeQueue.size();
            int currentLevelSum = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
                TreeNode* currentNode = nodeQueue.front();
                nodeQueue.pop();
                // Update node value to cousin sum.
                currentNode->val = previousLevelSum - currentNode->val;

                // Calculate sibling sum.
                int siblingSum =
                    (currentNode->left != nullptr ? currentNode->left->val
                                                  : 0) +
                    (currentNode->right != nullptr ? currentNode->right->val
                                                   : 0);

                if (currentNode->left != nullptr) {

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of nodes in the tree.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    We traverse each node in the binary tree exactly once. During the traversal, we perform constant-time operations to update the node values and calculate sibling sums. Since there are n nodes in total, the time complexity is O(n).
    
- Space complexity: O(n)
    
    The space complexity is primarily determined by the queue used in the BFS. In the worst case, when the tree is completely unbalanced (like a linked list), the queue can grow to hold all n nodes at once, leading to a space complexity of O(n). While there are no additional data structures like arrays that grow with the number of nodes, the queue remains the primary contributor to space complexity.
