### Description

Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size `groupSize`, and consists of `groupSize` consecutive cards.

Given an integer array `hand` where `hand[i]` is the value written on the `ith` card and an integer `groupSize`, return `true` if she can rearrange the cards, or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** hand = [1,2,3,4,5], groupSize = 4
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Alice's hand can not be rearranged into groups of 4.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= hand.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= hand[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= groupSize <= hand.length`

**Note:** This question is the same as 1296: [Divide Array in Set of k consecutive numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-in-sets-of-k-consecutive-numbers/)

**My Implementation**

```cpp
//Approach (Simply using map)
//T.C  : O(nlogn) + O(n*groupSize)
//S.C  : O(n)
class Solution {
public:
    bool isNStraightHand(vector<int>& hand, int groupSize) {
        int n = hand.size();

        if(n % groupSize) {
            return false;
        }

        map<int, int> mp;
        for(int &handNumber : hand) {
            mp[handNumber]++; //O(nlogn)
        }

        while(!mp.empty()) { //O(n*groupSize)

            int curr = mp.begin()->first; //->second : frequency

            for(int i = 0; i < groupSize; i++) {
                if(mp[curr + i] == 0) {
                    return false;
                }

                mp[curr+i]--;
                if(mp[curr+i] < 1) {
                    mp.erase(curr+i);
                }
            }

        }

        return true;
        
    }
};
```

# 🎯Problem Explaination:

The "Hand of Straights" problem involves determining whether a given list of integers (`hand`) can be divided into groups of a specified size (`groupSize`) where each group contains consecutive numbers. If it's possible to rearrange the hand into such groups, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

## 📥Input

1. `hand`: A list of integers representing the cards. Each integer in the list is a card value.
2. `groupSize`: An integer representing the size of each group of consecutive cards.

## 📤Output

- `True` if the `hand` can be rearranged into groups of consecutive cards of size `groupSize`.
- `False` if it is not possible to rearrange the `hand` into such groups.

# 🧠Thinking Behind the Solution:

1. **Check Group Size Compatibility**:
    
    - First, we check if the number of cards can be evenly divided by the group size (`groupSize`). If not, it's impossible to form the required groups, so we return `False` immediately.
2. **Count the Occurrences**:
    
    - We count how many times each card appears in the hand. This helps us know exactly how many of each card we have.
3. **Sort the Cards**:
    
    - We sort the unique card values in ascending order. Sorting helps us easily find and form consecutive groups starting from the smallest card.
4. **Form Consecutive Groups**:
    
    - For each unique card (starting from the smallest), we try to form a group of consecutive cards.
    - If the current card (let's call it `key`) appears in the hand, it means we need to form a group starting from this card. We check if there are enough cards to form a full group of `groupSize` starting from `key`.
    - For example, if `groupSize` is 3 and `key` is 2, we need the cards 2, 3, and 4 to form a valid group.
5. **Reduce the Count**:
    
    - For each card in the group, we reduce its count.
6. **Check for Insufficient Cards**:
    
    - If at any point, a card needed to complete a group is not available in the required quantity, we return `False`.
7. **Success**:
    
    - If we successfully form all required groups, we return `True`.

# Let's walkthrough🚶🏻‍♂️ the implementation process with an example for better understanding🎯:

**Input:**

```python
hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8]
groupSize = 3
```

**Steps:**

1. **Check Group Size Compatibility**:
    
    - `len(hand) % groupSize == 0`, so proceed (9 cards, group size 3).
2. **Count the Occurrences**:
    
    - Count: `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1}`
3. **Sort the Cards**:
    
    - Sorted unique cards: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]`
4. **Form Consecutive Groups**:
    
    - Start with `1`: Form group `[1, 2, 3]` (reduce counts: 1 from each).
    - Now counts: `{1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1}`
    - Next smallest card is `2`: Form group `[2, 3, 4]` (reduce counts: 1 from each).
    - Now counts: `{1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1}`
    - Next smallest card is `6`: Form group `[6, 7, 8]` (reduce counts: 1 from each).
    - Now counts: `{1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0, 8: 0}`
5. **Success**:
    
    - All cards are used up successfully in consecutive groups of size 3. Return `True`.

# ✅Approach:

1. **Check if Grouping is Possible**:
    
    - Ensure the total number of cards can be evenly divided by `groupSize`. If not, return `False`.
2. **Count the Occurrences of Each Card**:
    
    - Use a dictionary to count how many times each card appears in the hand.
3. **Sort the Unique Card Values**:
    
    - Sort the keys (unique card values) of the dictionary in ascending order. This helps in forming consecutive groups starting from the smallest card.
4. **Form Consecutive Groups**:
    
    - For each card in the sorted list, if it appears in the dictionary, try to form a group starting from that card.
    - Check if there are enough consecutive cards to form a complete group. If any card needed for the group is not available in the required quantity, return `False`.
    - Decrease the count of each card used to form the group.
5. **Return True if All Groups are Formed Successfully**:
    
    - If all cards are used up in forming valid groups, return `True`.

# Code👩🏻‍💻:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isNStraightHand(std::vector<int>& hand, int groupSize) {
        // Step 1: Check if grouping is possible
        if (hand.size() % groupSize != 0) {
            return false;
        }

        // Step 2: Count the occurrences of each card
        std::unordered_map<int, int> count;
        for (int card : hand) {
            count[card]++;
        }

        // Step 3: Sort the unique card values
        std::vector<int> sortedKeys;
        for (auto& pair : count) {
            sortedKeys.push_back(pair.first);
        }
        std::sort(sortedKeys.begin(), sortedKeys.end());

        // Step 4: Form consecutive groups
        for (int key : sortedKeys) {
            if (count[key] > 0) {  // If this card is still available
                int startCount = count[key];
                // Check and form a group starting from `key`
                for (int i = key; i < key + groupSize; i++) {
                    if (count[i] < startCount) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    count[i] -= startCount;
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 5: Return true if all groups are formed successfully
        return true;
    }
};
