### Description

A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by _exactly_ one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`)  are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs).

Return _a list of all **MHTs'** root labels_. You can return the answer in **any order**.

The **height** of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/01/e1.jpg)

**Input:** n = 4, edges = \[\[1,0],\[1,2],\[1,3]]
**Output:** \[1]
**Explanation:** As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/01/e2.jpg)

**Input:** n = 6, edges = \[\[3,0],\[3,1],\[3,2],\[3,4],\[5,4]]
**Output:** \[3,4]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
- `ai != bi`
- All the pairs `(ai, bi)` are distinct.
- The given input is **guaranteed** to be a tree and there will be **no repeated** edges.

**My Implementation**

```cpp
//Using Topological Sorting
//T.C : O(V+E)
//S.C : O(V+E)
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findMinHeightTrees(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        if(n == 1)
            return {0};
        
        vector<int> result;
        vector<int> indegree(n);
        map<int, vector<int>> adj;
        
        for(vector<int> vec:edges) {
            int u = vec[0];
            int v = vec[1];
            indegree[u]++;
            indegree[v]++;
            adj[u].push_back(v);
            adj[v].push_back(u);
        }
        
        queue<int> que;
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) {
            if(indegree[i] == 1) //adding all leafs node so that we can remove them later
                que.push(i);
        }
        
        while(n > 2) {
            int size = que.size();
            n -= size; //removing nodes with indegreee 1
            
            while(size--) {
                int u = que.front();
                que.pop();
                for(int v:adj[u]) {
                    indegree[v]--;
                    if(indegree[v] == 1)
                        que.push(v);
                }
            }
        }
        
        while(!que.empty()) {
            result.push_back(que.front());
            que.pop();
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

**Approach Summary :** 

The approach aims to find the minimum height trees in a given undirected graph represented by its nodes and edges. It does so by iteratively removing leaf nodes (nodes with only one neighbor) until there are at most two remaining nodes, which would be the root nodes of the minimum height trees. The key steps involved are: 

1. Constructing an adjacency list to represent the graph and calculating the indegree of each node. 
2. Enqueuing all leaf nodes (nodes with indegree 1) into a queue. 
3. Iteratively dequeuing leaf nodes and reducing the indegree of their neighbors. 
4. Removing the dequeued nodes and their adjacent edges from the graph. 
5. Repeating steps 2-4 until there are at most two nodes left in the graph. 
6. Returning the remaining nodes, which represent the roots of the minimum height trees. This approach efficiently identifies the nodes that form the roots of the minimum height trees by gradually trimming the graph from its outermost layers towards its core.

"Basic idea: the roots of MHT must be the mid points of the longest leaf to leaf path in the tree.  
And to find the longest path, we can first find the farthest leaf from any node, and then find  
the farthest leaf from the node found above. Then these two nodes we found are the end points  
of the longest path. And last, we find the centers of the longest path."

**Steps:**

1. Create adjcent list(neighbors)

2. Count in-degree of all vertices.

3. Pick any vertex 'v' which has in-degree of 0.

4. Print 'v'. Remove the vertex 'v' and all edges coming out of it. Decrement in-degrees of all neighbors of vertex 'v' by 1.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 till u either have just 1 or 2 nodes available.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findMinHeightTrees(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        if(n==0)

        if(n==1)
            return {0};
        vector<int>res;
        vector<int>degrees(n,0);
        vector<vector<int>>adj(n);
        for(int i=0;i<edges.size();i++)
        {
            adj[edges[i][0]].push_back(edges[i][1]);//creating adjacent list
            adj[edges[i][1]].push_back(edges[i][0]);
            degrees[edges[i][1]]++;//updating how many edges each node has
            degrees[edges[i][0]]++;
        }
        queue<int>queue;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(degrees[i]==1)//adding all the leave nodes
                queue.push(i);
        }
        while(!queue.empty())
        {
            res.clear();// clear vector before we start traversing level by level.
            int size=queue.size();
            for(int i=0;i<size;i++)
            {
                int cur=queue.front();
                queue.pop();
                res.push_back(cur);//adding nodes to vector.Goal is to get a vector of  just 1 or 2 nodes available.
                for(auto &neighbor:adj[cur])
                {
                    degrees[neighbor]--;//removing current leave nodes
                    if(degrees[neighbor]==1)//adding current leave nodes
                        queue.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
