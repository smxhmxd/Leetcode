### Description

Given a binary array `nums`, return _the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of_ `0` _and_ `1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** \[0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,0]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** \[0, 1] (or \[1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

> Replacing the 0 with -1 so that when there is equal number of 0 & 1 in a _contiguous subarray_ the sum of that subarray becomes 0

**My Implementation**

```cpp
//T.C : O(n)
//S.C : O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if(n == 1) return 0;
        
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        int currSum = 0;
        int maxL = 0;
        mp[0] = -1;
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) {
            
            currSum += (nums[i] == 1) ? 1 : -1;
            
            if(mp.find(currSum) != mp.end()) {
                maxL = max(maxL, i-mp[currSum]);
            } else
                mp[currSum] = i;
        }
        
        return maxL;
    }
};
```

#### Approach #1 Brute Force[TLE]
**Algorithm**

The brute force approach is really simple. We consider every possible subarray within the given array and count the number of zeros and ones in each subarray. Then, we find out the maximum size subarray with equal no. of zeros and ones out of them.

```java

public class Solution {

    public int findMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        int maxlen = 0;
        for (int start = 0; start < nums.length; start++) {
            int zeroes = 0, ones = 0;
            for (int end = start; end < nums.length; end++) {
                if (nums[end] == 0) {
                    zeroes++;
                } else {
                    ones++;
                }
                if (zeroes == ones) {
                maxlen = Math.max(maxlen, end - start + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return maxlen;
    }
}

```

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time complexity : O(n^2). We consider every possible subarray by traversing over the complete array for every start point possible.
    
- Space complexity : O(1). Only two variables zeroes and ones are required.

#### Approach #2 Using Extra Array 

**Algorithm**

In this approach, we make use of a count variable, which is used to store the relative number of ones and zeros encountered so far while traversing the array. The count variable is incremented by one for every 1 encountered and the same is decremented by one for every 0 encountered.

We start traversing the array from the beginning. If at any moment, the count becomes zero, it implies that we've encountered equal number of zeros and ones from the beginning till the current index of the array(iii). Not only this, another point to be noted is that if we encounter the same count twice while traversing the array, it means that the number of zeros and ones are equal between the indices corresponding to the equal count values. The following figure illustrates the observation for the sequence `[0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1]`:


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if(n == 1) return 0;
        
// Initialize an array to keep track of count of zeros and ones encountered so far
        vector<int> count(2 * n + 1, -2);
        count[n] = -1; // Initialize count at zero
        
        int currCount = 0;
        int maxL = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Update the count of zeros and ones encountered so far
            currCount += (nums[i] == 1) ? 1 : -1;
            
            // Calculate the index based on the current count
            int index = currCount + n;
            
            // If the current count has been encountered before, update maxL
            if(count[index] != -2) {
                maxL = max(maxL, i - count[index]);
            } else {
                // Otherwise, store the current count along with its index
                count[index] = i;
            }
        }
        
        return maxL;
    }
};


```

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time complexity : O(n). The complete array is traversed only once.
    
- Space complexity : O(n). arr array of size 2n+1 is used.
    

Explanation on why count size is 2*n+1,
- 
This approach uses an array count to keep track of the count of zeros and ones encountered so far. The index of the array represents the count, with an offset of n to handle negative counts. This way, you can achieve the same result without using a map.

Step by step explanation -
1. Initialization: 
   - Define variables: `n` as the size of the input vector `nums`, `currCount` to keep track of the count of zeros and ones encountered so far, and `maxL` to store the length of the largest subarray with equal number of zeros and ones.
   - Initialize a vector count of size 2 * n + 1  to keep track of counts. Initialize all elements to -2 to indicate that they have not been encountered yet. Set count[n] to -1 to represent the initial count of zero.

2. Iterate through the array `nums`:
   - Update the `currCount` based on the current element in `nums`. If the element is 1, increment `currCount`; if it's 0, decrement `currCount`.
   - Calculate the index `index` in the `count` array corresponding to the current count, with an offset of `n`.

3. Check if the current count has been encountered before:
   - If `count[index]` is not equal to -2, it means the current count has been encountered before. Calculate the length of the subarray with equal number of zeros and ones by subtracting the current index from the index stored in `count[index]`. Update `maxL` if necessary.
   - If `count[index]` is equal to -2, it means the current count is encountered for the first time. Store the current index in `count[index]`.

4. Return `maxL` as the result, which represents the length of the largest subarray with equal number of zeros and ones encountered during the iteration.
