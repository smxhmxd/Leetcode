### Description

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters and an integer `k`. We call a string `t` **ideal** if the following conditions are satisfied:

- `t` is a **subsequence** of the string `s`.
- The absolute difference in the alphabet order of every two **adjacent** letters in `t` is less than or equal to `k`.

Return _the length of the **longest** ideal string_.

A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

**Note** that the alphabet order is not cyclic. For example, the absolute difference in the alphabet order of `'a'` and `'z'` is `25`, not `1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "acfgbd", k = 2
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest ideal string is "acbd". The length of this string is 4, so 4 is returned.
Note that "acfgbd" is not ideal because 'c' and 'f' have a difference of 3 in alphabet order.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "abcd", k = 3
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest ideal string is "abcd". The length of this string is 4, so 4 is returned.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= k <= 25`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

**My Implementation**

```cpp
//Approach-1 (Using LIS code eactly)
//Works perfectly but gives TLE bcoz of 10^5 constraint which is a lot on O(n^2) T.C
//T.C : O(n^2)
//S.C : O(n)
class Solution {
public:
    int longestIdealString(string s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        
        int result = 1;
        vector<int> t(n, 1);
        //t[i] = Longest Ideal Subsequence ending at index i
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                
                if(abs(s[j] - s[i]) <= k) {
                    t[i] = max(t[i], t[j]+1);
                }
            }
            result = max(result, t[i]);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};


//Approach-2 (Optimised - Chec only those characters for s[i] such that abs(ch - s[i]) <=k)
//T.C : O(n)
//S.C : O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    int longestIdealString(string s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        
        vector<int> t(26, 0);
        
        int result = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            
            int curr    = s[i]-'a';
            int left    = max(0, curr-k);
            int right   = min(25, curr+k);

            int longest = 0;
            for(int j = left; j <= right; j++) {
                longest = max(longest, t[j]);
            }
            
            t[curr] = max(t[curr], longest+1);
            result = max(result, t[curr]);
        }
        
        return result;
        
    }
};
```

## 🤔 Intuition

The problem asks us to find the length of the longest ideal string, where an ideal string satisfies two conditions:

1. It is a subsequence of the given string 's'.
2. The absolute difference in the alphabet order of every two adjacent letters in the string is less than or equal to 'k'.

## 🛠️ Approach

1. Initialize an array `dp` of size 27 to store the length of the longest ideal string ending at each character.
2. Iterate through the string 's' from right to left.
3. For each character, calculate the index in the array 'dp' based on its ASCII value and subtract 'a' (97) to get the index from 0 to 26.
4. Determine the range of possible previous characters based on the value of 'k'.
5. Iterate through this range and find the maximum value of 'dp'.
6. Update 'dp' at the current character's index with the maximum value found plus 1.
7. After processing all characters, find the maximum value in the 'dp' array, which represents the length of the longest ideal string.
8. Return this maximum value as the result.

## Complexity 📊

- Time complexity:
    - The loop iterates through the string 's' once, and for each character, it may iterate through a constant range of characters (bounded by 'k'). Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.
- Space complexity:
    - We use an array 'dp' of size 27 to store the lengths of ideal strings, which is constant space. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).


# Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestIdealString(string s, int k) {
        int dp[27] = {0};
        int n = s.length();

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            char cc = s[i];
            int idx = cc - 'a';
            int maxi = -__INT_MAX__;

            int left = max((idx - k), 0);
            int right = min((idx + k), 26);

            for (int j = left; j <= right; j++) {
                maxi = max(maxi, dp[j]);
            }

            dp[idx] = maxi + 1;
        }

        int max = -__INT_MAX__;
        for (int i = 0; i < 27; i++) {
            if (dp[i] > max)
                max = dp[i];
        }

        return max;
    }
};
```
