### Description

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return _the reversed list_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex1.jpg)

**Input:** head = \[1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** \[5,4,3,2,1]

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex2.jpg)

**Input:** head = \[1,2]
**Output:** \[2,1]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[]
**Output:** \[]

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

**Follow up:** A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

**My Implementation**

```cpp
//Approach-1 (Using Recursion - I)
//T.C : O(m+n)
//S.C : O(1) (Ignoring recursion stack space)
class Solution {
public:
    
    ListNode* reverseSolve(ListNode* head) {
        
        if(!head || !head->next)
            return head;
        
        ListNode* last   = reverseSolve(head->next);
        // returns the last node of the linkedlist
        head->next->next = head;
// (head)3 -> 4 -> 5 if this is the given linkedlist, head->next->next will point to the next of 4 which is 5 we will change it to the head 4 -> 3(head) 
        head->next       = NULL;
// than we will break the excisting 3 -> 4 link bcoz next(4) is pointing to 3 and next(3) is point to 4 i.e. 3 ↔️ 4 
        return last;
// we will return the last node as it will become the new head     
    }
// What we are doing here is we are reversing the link of each node ( 3 -> 4 to 4 -> 3 ) and returning the last element of the LL as it will act as the new head when the LL is reversed
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        return reverseSolve(head);
    }
};


//Approach-2 (Using Recursio - II)
//T.C : O(m+n)
//S.C : O(1) (Ignoring recursion stack space)
class Solution {
public:
    
    ListNode* reverseHelp(ListNode* head, ListNode* prev) {
        
        if(!head)
            return prev;
        
        ListNode* temp = head->next;
        head->next = prev;
        
        return reverseHelp(temp, head);
    }
    
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        return reverseHelp(head, NULL);
    }
};


//Approach-3 (Iterative)
//T.C : O(n)
//S.C : O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* prev = NULL;
        
        while (head != NULL) {
            ListNode* next = head->next;
            head->next = prev;
            prev = head;
            head = next;
        }
        return prev;
    }
};

/*
The main responsibility of curr is to tell us where exactly you are standing. And prev tells us the node previous to curr. 
Now, as we start, curr is head and since there is no previous to head, so prev = NULL. Now, the main work we have to do is, as curr moves ahead, we have to make curr point to it's prev node instead of next node. 
So, we do it by swap(curr->next, prev); -> This lines makes the curr point to it's previous node. Note that here, curr's next value is changed only but curr is still at the same node. 
Also note that, prev has now got the value of old curr->next value (where we have to move ahead now) ----> Point-1 Now, as we move ahead, we have to ensure that curr should move ahead . 
How to move curr further ? See Point-1 above, prev already has that value. So assign curr = prev and prev should now become curr (hence we wrote swap(prev, curr); to achieve that)
