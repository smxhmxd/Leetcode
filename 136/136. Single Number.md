### Description

Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears _twice_ except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,2,1\]
**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,1,2,1,2\]
**Output:** 4

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104`
*   Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

**My Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int,int> mp;
        for (auto a : nums) {
            mp[a]++;
        }  
        int ele;
        for (auto& pair : mp) 
        {
        if (pair.second == 1 ) 
        {
            ele = pair.first;
            break;
        }
    }
    return ele;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int result = 0;

        for (int i: nums)
        {
            result ^= i;
        }
        return result;

    }
};
```

_**Brief note about Question-**_

- We have to return the number which is _appears single time_ in the array.

```cpp
Let's take an example not given in question -
Suppose our array is arr[]: [5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 4]

So, our answer should be '7' as it appears only single time in the array. 
```

_**Solution - I (using unordered map, Accepted)-**_

- Since we are very obedient person and don't want to do anything extra from our side.
- So, on seeing the question, the first idea that clicks to our mind is to _**store frequency**_ of all over the elements.
- After storing frequency, we will simply _**find the element whose frequency is 1**_.
- The element whose frequency is 1, that is our answer.

```cpp
Time Complexity --> O(n) // where n is the size of the array
Space Complexity --> O(n) // we will store the frequency of every element

It paases [ 61 / 61 ] in built test cases
```

_**So, How we will implement that?**_

- Whenever we heard the name _frequency_, we will call our one and only superhero i.e `unordered_map`.
- We will store frequency of each element in our unorderd map.
- After that, we **traverse from the map**, and for every element we check whether it's **frequency is 1** or not.
- If it's frequency is 1, then we will simply store the answer and break the loop.
- See, an example.

```cpp
Suppose our array is arr[]: [5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 4]
so, after storing frequency of each element in our map, our map looks like -
5 -> 2
1 -> 2
3 -> 2
4 -> 2
7 -> 1     On traversing, we will see that it's frequency is 1, so this should be our answer.
```

**Code (C++)**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size(); // taking the size of the array 
        
        unordered_map<int, int> mp; 
        // unordered map to store the frequency
        
        // storing frequency in the map
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            mp[arr[i]]++;
        }
        
        int ans; // variable to store our answer
        for(auto x: mp) // traverse from the map
        {
            if(x.second == 1) //if frequency of any elemennt is 1
            {
                ans = x.first; // store in our answer
                break; 
                // break the loop, as we got our answer now
            }
        }
        
        return ans; // return ans
    }
};
```

_**Solution - II (using property of xor, Accepted)-**_

- Now, the question arises, is their any way so that we do not need to store frequency, i.e  
    **can we space optimized our answer**?
- Since, we want not to use map, so we will see our map that where is the problem?
- We observe a very basic thing that other than our answer, **frequency of each element is 2**, that means our question wants to say that, _**every element appears twice except the single one and we have to find that particular single element.**_
- So, if every element appears twice, _do we really need to store the frequency of each element_?
- Answer is **No**, we do not need to store the frequency of each element because we already know that, for each element their is only two ways, **either it's frequency is 1 or it's frequency is 2**. Their is not any third option other than that.
- In this way, we can think of _**the property of XOR-**_

```cpp
0 ^ 0 --> 0
0 ^ 1 --> 1
1 ^ 0 --> 1
1 ^ 1 --> 0
```

- If we see, we will find out that _**xor of two same number is zero**_.
- Can we use this property here?
- Answer is _**Yes**_. But how?
- We will run a loop from all over the array, and simply start taking xor of two.
- We do xor between prev answer of xor and current element.
- See dry run for more clarification.
- But, Question is **WHY**? why this works?

```cpp
We know every number is appears twice except a single number which appears only single time.

See, we already discuss a thing a that xor of a same number with itself is zero, i.e A ^ A = 0
Now, we will look some more property of xor-

1) xor of a same number with itself is zero, i.e A ^ A = 0
2) xor is commutative that means a ^ b = b ^ a.
3) xor of any number with zero is the number itself i.e A ^ 0 = A.

Suppose our array is arr[]: [5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 4]
we will rearrange the array, and take all the numbers together, then our array looks like
arr[]: [1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7]
now, take xor of all numbers -
1 ^ 1 ^ 3 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 4 ^ 5 ^ 5 ^ 7   (rearrange the array)
0   ^   0   ^   0   ^   0   ^ 7     (see point number 1)
7                                   (see point number 3) 
```

- Now, The question again arises, **do we really need to rearrange the array ?**
- Answer is _**NO**_.
- We already know a property of xor, that says we don't need to rearrange the array. But wait, where?
- `xor is commutative that means a ^ b = b ^ a. (see above point number 2)`
- Okay, if this is ? **Can you do this without rearaanging the array?**
- Answer is **Yes**, see below-

```csharp
So, our array is arr[]: [5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 4] 

[5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 4]
 ↑  ↑
 5 ^ 1 = 4
 
[5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 4]
       ↑                       
	   4 ^ 3 = 7 (prev answer xor current index)
	   
[5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 4]
	      ↑
		  7 ^ 1 = 6 (prev answer xor current index)
		  
[5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 4]
             ↑
			 6 ^ 3 = 5 (prev answer xor current index)

[5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 4]
                ↑
				5 ^ 4 = 1  (prev answer xor current index)
				
[5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 4]
                   ↑
				   1 ^ 5 = 4 (prev answer xor current index)
				   
[5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 4]
                      ↑
					  4 ^ 7 = 3 (prev answer xor current index)
					  
[5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 4]
                         ↑
						 3 ^ 4 = 7 (prev answer xor current index)
						 
So, the element which we got as left should be our answer, so the answer is '7'
```

```cpp
Time Complexity --> O(n) // where n is the size of the array
Space Complexity --> O(1) // we are not using anything extra from our side

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size(); 
        // extracting the size of the array
        
        // traverse from the array
        for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
        {
            arr[i + 1] = arr[i] ^ arr[i + 1]; 
            // (prev answer xor current index)
        }
        
        return arr[n- 1]; // return left over element
    }
};
