### Description

Given two integersÂ `left`Â andÂ `right`Â that represent the rangeÂ `[left, right]`, returnÂ _the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** left = 5, right = 7
**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** left = 0, right = 0
**Output:** 0

**Example 3:**

**Input:** left = 1, right = 2147483647
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= left <= right <= 2^31 - 1`

**My Implementation**

```cpp
//Approach-1 (Using shift)
//T.C : O(log(n)), where n is the maximum number of bits needed to represent the given input integers left and right.
//S.C : O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        int shiftCount = 0;
        
        while(left != right) {
            left >>= 1;
            right >>= 1;
            shiftCount++;
        }
        
        return left << shiftCount;
    }
};


//Approach-2 (Using AND property)
//T.C : O(log(n)), where n is the maximum number of bits needed to represent the given input integers left and right.
//S.C : O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        while(right > left) {
            right = right & (right-1);
        }
        
        return right;
    }
};
```

Approach Summary : 
Approach-1 (Using Shift): 
Time Complexity (T.C): O(log(n)), where n is the maximum number of bits needed to represent the given input integers left and right. 
Space Complexity (S.C): O(1) 
Summary: This approach iteratively right-shifts both left and right until they become equal, counting the number of shifts. The result is obtained by left-shifting left by the count of shifts. 

Approach-2 (Using AND Property): 
Time Complexity (T.C): O(log(n)), where n is the maximum number of bits needed to represent the given input integers left and right. 
Space Complexity (S.C): O(1) 
Summary: This approach iteratively applies the bitwise AND operation on right and (right - 1) until right becomes less than or equal to left. The result is the value of right after the loop. Both approaches aim to find the bitwise AND of a range of integers (left to right), with the first approach using a shift-based method and the second approach utilizing the property that bitwise AND between a number and its predecessor resets the rightmost set bit.

# Approaches

(Also explained in the code)

1. **Common Prefix Identification:**
    
    - The function iteratively right-shifts bothÂ `left`Â andÂ `right`Â until they become equal, identifying the common prefix of their binary representations.
2. **Counting Shifts:**
    
    - It counts the number of right-shifts performed, storing the count in the variableÂ `cnt`.
3. **Bitwise AND Calculation:**
    
    - After finding the common prefix, it reconstructs the bitwise AND result by left-shifting the common prefix byÂ `cnt`Â bits.

left_=5_and_right_=7

```cpp
left_=5_and_right_=7
Lets manually apply & operation on all elements present in the 
range 5 and 7 including themself.

            5 = 101
            6 = 110
            7 = 111

AND operations:
            0 & 0 = 0
            0 & 1 = 0
            1 & 0 = 0
            1 & 1 = 1

With the help of above operations lets perform AND operations.

            101(5) & 110(6) = 100(4)

            100(4) & 111(7) = 100(4)

    answer = 4


Now lets apply the method used in the code:

we will remove last digit from binary representation of both left
and right number until we reach a point where both have same 
element at the same position.
And will also keep track of how many times we removed elements 
by keeping a count of it.

lets apply it practically:

first loop:
            101 >> 1 = 10
            111 >> 1 = 11
            cnt = 1

Second loop:
            10 >> 1 = 1
            11 >> 1 = 1
            cnt = 2

Third loop:
            1 == 1 
So now since they are equal we will add those many 0's at the 
end of the current element we have by using left shift operator.

            1 << cnt  = 1 << 2  => 100(4) 


    Result = 4



```

.

In both right and left shift, elements will be removed and added from the last only.

# Complexity

- Space complexity:

# Code

```cpp
class Solution {

    int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        int cnt = 0;
        while (left != right) {
            left >>= 1;
            right >>= 1;
            cnt++;
        }
        return (left << cnt);
    }
};
