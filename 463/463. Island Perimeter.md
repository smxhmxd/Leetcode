### Description

You are given `row x col` `grid` representing a map where `grid[i][j] = 1` represents land and `grid[i][j] = 0` represents water.

Grid cells are connected **horizontally/vertically** (not diagonally). The `grid` is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/island.png)

**Input:** grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
**Output:** 16
**Explanation:** The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image above.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[1]]
**Output:** 4

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,0]]
**Output:** 4

**Constraints:**

- `row == grid.length`
- `col == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= row, col <= 100`
- `grid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
- There is exactly one island in `grid`.

# Problem Explaination🎯:

The `Island Perimeter` problem involves calculating the perimeter of an island represented by a 2D grid where `1` denotes land and `0` denotes water. Each cell of land contributes to the perimeter based on its surrounding neighboring cells.

# 🔍 Methods To Solve This Problem:

I'll be covering two different methods to solve this problem:

1. Iterative Approach with Counting Borders
2. Depth-First Search (DFS)

# 1️⃣ Iterative Approach with Counting Borders:

In this method, we iterate through each cell of the grid. For every cell that represents land (denoted by `1`), we initially assume it contributes 4 units to the perimeter. Then, we adjust this count based on the neighboring cells.

- For each land cell (`grid[r][c] == 1`), add 4 to the perimeter count since the cell has four potential sides.
- Check the left neighbor (`grid[r][c-1]`) and the top neighbor (`grid[r-1][c]`). If either of these neighbors is also land (`1`), it means the shared side between the current cell and its neighbor is internal to the island and should not contribute to the perimeter. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the perimeter count for each such shared side.

By iterating over all cells and adjusting the perimeter count accordingly, we can efficiently compute the total perimeter of the entire island.

# Code👨🏻‍💻:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int islandPerimeter(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int perimeter = 0;
        int rows = grid.size();
        int cols = grid[0].size();
        
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
                if (grid[r][c] == 1) {
                    perimeter += 4;
                    if (r > 0 && grid[r-1][c] == 1) {
                        perimeter -= 2;
                    }
                    if (c > 0 && grid[r][c-1] == 1) {
                        perimeter -= 2;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return perimeter;
    }
};
```

# 2️⃣ Depth-First Search (DFS):

This method utilizes Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse and count the perimeter of the island. We define a helper function `dfs(r, c)` that recursively explores all adjacent cells of a given cell `(r, c)`.

- If a cell is out of the grid bounds or is water (`0`), it contributes 1 to the perimeter (since water cells have an exposed border).
- If a cell is land (`1`), we mark it as visited by changing its value to `-1` to avoid recounting, then recursively explore its four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right).
- The base case for the recursion is when the cell is out of bounds or is water, which contributes 1 to the perimeter.

By iterating through each cell of the grid and invoking the `dfs` function on unvisited land cells, we can compute the total perimeter of the island.

# Code👩🏻‍💻:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int islandPerimeter(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int rows = grid.size();
        int cols = grid[0].size();
        int perimeter = 0;

        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
                if (grid[r][c] == 1) {
                    perimeter += dfs(grid, r, c);
                }
            }
        }

        return perimeter;
    }

private:
    int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int r, int c) {
        // Base cases for DFS recursion
        if (r < 0 || r >= grid.size() || c < 0 || c >= grid[0].size() || grid[r][c] == 0) {
            return 1; // Water contributes 1 to perimeter
        }
        if (grid[r][c] == -1) {
            return 0; // Already visited land cell
        }

        // Mark cell as visited
        grid[r][c] = -1;

        // Explore neighbors (up, down, left, right)
        return (dfs(grid, r + 1, c) +
                dfs(grid, r - 1, c) +
                dfs(grid, r, c + 1) +
                dfs(grid, r, c - 1));
    }
};
```
