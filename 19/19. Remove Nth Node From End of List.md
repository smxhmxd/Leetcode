### Description

Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `nth` node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/remove_ex1.jpg)

**Input:** head = \[1,2,3,4,5\], n = 2
**Output:** \[1,2,3,5\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[1\], n = 1
**Output:** \[\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[1,2\], n = 1
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
*   `1 <= sz <= 30`
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   `1 <= n <= sz`

**Follow up:** Could you do this in one pass?

**My Implementation**

```cpp
//Approach-1 (2 Pass)
//T.C : O(n)
//S.C : O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    
    int lengthLinkedList(ListNode* head) {
        int l = 0;
        
        while(head) {
            l++;
            head = head->next;
        }
        return l;
    }
    
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        int length = lengthLinkedList(head);
        
        if(length == n) { 
//If Length = n it means we have to delete the head node
            ListNode* temp = head->next;
            delete(head);
            return temp;
        }

        ListNode* temp = head;
        ListNode* prev = NULL;
        int travel = length-n;
        
        while(travel--) {
            prev = temp;
            temp = temp->next;
        }

        prev->next = temp->next;
        
        delete(temp);   
        
        return head;
        
    }
};

//Approach-2 (1 Pass)
//T.C : O(n)
//S.C : O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        ListNode* fast = head;
        ListNode* slow = head;
        
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            fast = fast->next;
        }
        if(fast == NULL) {
            return head->next;
        }
        
        while(fast && fast->next) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next;
        }
        
        ListNode* temp = slow->next;
        slow->next = slow->next->next;
        delete(temp);
        return head;
    }
};
```

#### _**Idea:**_

With a singly linked list, the _only_ way to find the end of the list, and thus the **n**'th node from the end, is to actually iterate all the way to the end. The challenge here is attemping to find the solution in only one pass. A naive approach here might be to store pointers to each node in an array, allowing us to calculate the **n**'th from the end once we reach the end, but that would take **O(M) extra space**, where **M** is the length of the linked list.

A slightly less naive approach would be to only store only the last **n+1** node pointers in the array. This could be achieved by overwriting the elements of the storage array in circlular fashion as we iterate through the list. This would lower the **space complexity** to **O(N+1)**.

In order to solve this problem in only one pass and **O(1) extra space**, however, we would need to find a way to _both_ reach the end of the list with one pointer _and also_ reach the **n**'th node from the end simultaneously with a second pointer.

To do that, we can simply stagger our two pointers by **n** nodes by giving the first pointer (**fast**) a head start before starting the second pointer (**slow**). Doing this will cause **slow** to reach the **n**'th node from the end at the same time that **fast** reaches the end.

Since we will need access to the node _before_ the target node in order to remove the target node, we can use **fast.next == null** as our exit condition, rather than **fast == null**, so that we stop one node earlier.

This will unfortunately cause a problem when **n** is the same as the length of the list, which would make the first node the target node, and thus make it impossible to find the node _before_ the target node. If that's the case, however, we can just **return head.next** without needing to stitch together the two sides of the target node.

Otherwise, once we succesfully find the node _before_ the target, we can then stitch it together with the node _after_ the target, and then **return head**.

#### _**Implementation:**_

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        ListNode *fast = head, *slow = head;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
        fast = fast->next;
        } 
        if (!fast) return head->next;
        while (fast->next) 
        {
        fast = fast->next;
        slow = slow->next;
        }
        slow->next = slow->next->next;
        return head;
    }
};
```
