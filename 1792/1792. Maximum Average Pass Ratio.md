### Description

There is a school that has classes of students and each class will be having a final exam. You are given a 2D integer array `classes`, where `classes[i] = [passi, totali]`. You know beforehand that in the `ith` class, there are `totali` total students, but only `passi` number of students will pass the exam.

You are also given an integer `extraStudents`. There are another `extraStudents` brilliant students that are **guaranteed** to pass the exam of any class they are assigned to. You want to assign each of the `extraStudents` students to a class in a way that **maximizes** the **average** pass ratio across **all** the classes.

The **pass ratio** of a class is equal to the number of students of the class that will pass the exam divided by the total number of students of the class. The **average pass ratio** is the sum of pass ratios of all the classes divided by the number of the classes.

Return _the **maximum** possible average pass ratio after assigning the_ `extraStudents` _students._ Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

```cpp
Input: classes = [[1,2],[3,5],[2,2]], 
extraStudents = 2
Output: 0.78333
```
**Explanation:** You can assign the two extra students to the first class. The average pass ratio will be equal to (3/4 + 3/5 + 2/2) / 3 = 0.78333.

**Example 2:**

```cpp
Input: classes = [[2,4],[3,9],[4,5],[2,10]], 
extraStudents = 4
Output: 0.53485
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= classes.length <= 10^5`
- `classes[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= passi <= totali <= 10^5`
- `1 <= extraStudents <= 10^5`

**My Implementation**

```cpp
/*
    Why normal Greedy fails ?
    Assigning extra students to the class with the least passing ratio assumes that improving the worst-performing class will maximize the overall average.
    However, this ignores the fact that the rate of improvement (or marginal gain) varies depending on the current number of passing and total students
    in the class. A class with a low passing ratio might require many additional students to see a significant improvement in its passing ratio,
    while a class with a higher passing ratio might see a much larger improvement with the same number of extra students.

## Solution

### Overview

Imagine a school where each class has students preparing for their final exams. Some students in each class are expected to pass, while others may fail. Now, imagine you have a few extra brilliant students who are guaranteed to pass, and you can assign them to any class. The goal is to determine the highest possible average pass ratio across all classes after distributing these extra students.

The pass ratio of a class is calculated as the number of passing students divided by the total number of students in that class. To find the highest possible average pass ratio, we should focus on assigning each extra student to the class where the addition of that student results in the highest relative increase in pass ratio. For example, adding a brilliant student to a class with fewer passing students can have a bigger impact than adding them to a class that already has a high pass ratio.

##### Key Details:

1. The pass ratio for a class is calculated as:

Pass Ratio=totali​passi​​, where passi​ is the number of passing students and totali​ is the total number of students.​​

2. The average pass ratio is defined as:

Average Pass Ratio=Number of ClassesSum of Pass Ratios of All Classes​​​

Now the question is, how is this greedy strategy working? This strategy picks the class that shows the largest increase in ratio when an extra student is added at each step. Why don't we pick the class with the largest increase in ratio when adding two extra students? Why is it guaranteed that the current step is optimal, as it seems to depend on the result of the previous step? Let's formally prove this in the proof below.

### Approach 1: Brute Force (Time Limit Exceeded Error)

#### Intuition

So, from what we've gathered, our main goal is to maximize the overall pass rate across all classes by strategically adding a set number of extra students. To do this, we need to figure out where each extra student will make the biggest difference in terms of improving the pass rate. This means we need to evaluate how much each class's pass rate would improve if we added just one more student.

First off, we calculate the current pass rate for each class. This is simply the ratio of students who passed to the total number of students in that class.

Once we have these ratios, we can start looking at each class one by one and see how much the pass rate would go up if we added one student. By comparing these improvements across all classes, we can identify which class would benefit the most from an extra student. This way, we make sure that each extra student is placed where they'll have the greatest impact on the overall pass rate.

After placing a student in the class that benefits the most, we update that class's pass rate and repeat the process until we've distributed all the extra students.

Finally, once we've updated all the pass rates, we calculate the average pass rate across all classes.

However, given that there can be up to 100,000 classes and 100,000 extra students, this approach will result in a Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) error.

#### Algorithm

- Initialize a `passRatios` array to store the initial pass ratio for each class.
    
    - For each class in `classes`, compute the ratio of passed students to total students and store it in `passRatios`.
- While `extraStudents` is greater than zero:
    
    - Decrement `extraStudents` by 1.
    - Initialize an `updatedRatios` array to store the pass ratios if an extra student is added to each class.
        - For each class in `classes`, calculate the new ratio of passed students to total students after adding one student and store it in `updatedRatios`.
    - Find the class that gains the most from an extra student:
        - Initialize `bestClassIndex` to 0 and `maximumGain` to 0.
        - For each class, compute the gain in the pass ratio by subtracting the current ratio from the updated ratio.
        - If the gain is greater than `maximumGain`, update `bestClassIndex` and `maximumGain` accordingly.
    - Update the selected class by incrementing its passed students and total students.
    - Update `passRatios` with the new ratio for the selected class.
- Initialize `totalPassRatio` to 0.
    
    - Sum up all the pass ratios from `passRatios`.
- Return the average pass ratio by dividing `totalPassRatio` by the number of classes.
    

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double maxAverageRatio(vector<vector<int>>& classes, int extraStudents) {
        vector<double> passRatios;

        // Calculate initial pass ratios
        for (int classIndex = 0; classIndex < classes.size(); classIndex++) {
            double initialRatio =
                classes[classIndex][0] / (double)classes[classIndex][1];
            passRatios.push_back(initialRatio);
        }

        while (extraStudents--) {
            vector<double> updatedRatios;

            // Calculate updated pass ratios if an extra student is added
            for (int classIndex = 0; classIndex < classes.size();
                 classIndex++) {
                double newRatio = (classes[classIndex][0] + 1) /
                                  (double)(classes[classIndex][1] + 1);
                updatedRatios.push_back(newRatio);
            }

            int bestClassIndex = 0;
            double maximumGain = 0;

            // Find the class that gains the most from an extra student
            for (int classIndex = 0; classIndex < updatedRatios.size();
                 classIndex++) {
                double gain =
                    updatedRatios[classIndex] - passRatios[classIndex];
                if (gain > maximumGain) {
                    bestClassIndex = classIndex;
                    maximumGain = gain;
                }
            }

            // Update the selected class
            passRatios[bestClassIndex] = updatedRatios[bestClassIndex];
            classes[bestClassIndex][0]++;
            classes[bestClassIndex][1]++;
        }

        // Calculate the total average pass ratio
        double totalPassRatio = 0;
        for (double passRatio : passRatios) {
            totalPassRatio += passRatio;
        }

        return totalPassRatio / classes.size();
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of classes in the `classes` array and k be the number of extra students.

- Time complexity: O(k⋅n)
    
    The outer loop runs k times (once for each extra student).
    
    Inside the loop, we have two main operations:  
    1. Calculating the updated pass ratios for all classes: This involves iterating over all n classes, resulting in O(n) time.  
    2. Finding the class with the maximum gain: This involves another iteration over all n classes, resulting in O(n) time.
    
    Therefore, the total time complexity is O(k⋅n).
    
- Space complexity: O(n)
    
    We use a array `passRatios` of size n to store the pass ratios of all classes. Additionally, we use a temporary array `updatedRatios` of size n to store the updated pass ratios. The space complexity is dominated by these two arrays, resulting in O(n) space.

### Approach 2: Priority Queue

#### Intuition

In Approach 1, we used an array and maintained a tracking variable, `maximumGain`, to record the maximum difference between the new and old pass ratios. However, this approach resulted in a TLE due to the extra loop used to find the maximum difference. To optimize this, we can eliminate the loop by using a priority queue.

First, we need a clear way to measure improvement. We create a lambda function called `calculateGain` to compute how much the pass ratio of a class would increase if an extra student were added. This provides a consistent metric to evaluate and compare the potential impact on different classes.

Next, we build a max heap. Each class is represented by a tuple containing its negative gain (to simulate a max heap using Python's default min heap), along with its current number of passed and total students. This ensures that the class with the highest gain can always be retrieved efficiently.

We then distribute the extra students iteratively. At each step, we pop the class with the highest potential gain from the heap. We simulate the addition of one extra student to this class, updating its number of passed and total students. We then recalculate its gain and push the updated class back into the heap, allowing us to continuously adjust to the changing gains of each class as students are allocated.

After all extra students are distributed, we compute the final result. By popping all classes from the heap and summing their current pass ratios, we calculate the total pass ratio. Dividing this sum by the number of classes gives us the average pass ratio.

#### Algorithm

- Define a lambda function `calculateGain` to compute the gain in pass ratio by adding an extra student to a class.
    
- Initialize a max heap (`maxHeap`) to store tuples of the form `(-gain, {passes, totalStudents})` ; The negative gain ensures the largest gain is at the top of the heap.
    
    - For each class in `classes`, calculate the gain using `calculateGain` and push the tuple into `maxHeap`.
- While there are `extraStudents` to distribute:
    
    - Decrement `extraStudents` by 1.
    - Pop the class with the maximum gain from `maxHeap`.
    - Extract `passes` and `totalStudents` of the class.
    - Update the class with one additional pass and one additional total student.
    - Recalculate the gain for this updated class and push the new tuple back into `maxHeap`.
- Initialize `totalPassRatio` to 0 for calculating the overall pass ratio.
    
    - While `maxHeap` is not empty, pop each class and add its pass ratio (`passes / totalStudents`) to `totalPassRatio`.
- Return the final average pass ratio by dividing `totalPassRatio` by the number of classes.
    

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double maxAverageRatio(vector<vector<int>>& classes, int extraStudents) {
        // Lambda to calculate the gain of adding an extra student
        auto calculateGain = [](int passes, int totalStudents) {
            return (double)(passes + 1) / (totalStudents + 1) -
                   (double)passes / totalStudents;
        };

        // Max heap to store (-gain, passes, totalStudents)
        priority_queue<pair<double, pair<int, int>>> maxHeap;
        for (const auto& singleClass : classes) {
            maxHeap.push({calculateGain(singleClass[0], singleClass[1]),
                          {singleClass[0], singleClass[1]}});
        }

        // Distribute extra students
        while (extraStudents--) {
            auto [currentGain, classInfo] = maxHeap.top();
            maxHeap.pop();
            int passes = classInfo.first;
            int totalStudents = classInfo.second;
            maxHeap.push({calculateGain(passes + 1, totalStudents + 1),
                          {passes + 1, totalStudents + 1}});
        }

        // Calculate the final average pass ratio
        double totalPassRatio = 0;
        while (!maxHeap.empty()) {
            auto [_, classInfo] = maxHeap.top();
            maxHeap.pop();
            totalPassRatio += (double)classInfo.first / classInfo.second;
        }

        return totalPassRatio / classes.size();
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of classes in the `classes` array and k be the number of extra students.

- Time complexity: O(nlogn)
    
    Building the max heap: Inserting each class into the max heap takes O(logn) time per insertion, and since there are n classes, this step takes O(nlogn) time.
    
    - Distributing extra students: Each insertion and removal from the max heap takes O(logn) time. Since we perform this operation k⋅ times, this step takes O(k⋅logn) time.
    - Calculating the final average pass ratio: This involves iterating through the heap, which takes O(nlogn) time in the worst case.
    
    Overall, the dominant factor is the initial heap construction and the distribution of extra students, leading to a time complexity of O(klogn+nlogn)=O(nlogn).
    
- Space complexity: O(n)
    
    The space complexity is determined by the max heap, which stores n elements (one for each class). Additionally, the lambda function and other local variables consume constant space.
    
    Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).
