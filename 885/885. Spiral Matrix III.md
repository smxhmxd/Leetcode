### Description

You start at the cell `(rStart, cStart)` of an `rows x cols` grid facing east. The northwest corner is at the first row and column in the grid, and the southeast corner is at the last row and column.

You will walk in a clockwise spiral shape to visit every position in this grid. Whenever you move outside the grid's boundary, we continue our walk outside the grid (but may return to the grid boundary later.). Eventually, we reach all `rows * cols` spaces of the grid.

Return _an array of coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order you visited them_.

**My Implementation**

```cpp
//Simple SImulation
//T.C : O(max(rows,cols)^2)
//S.C : O(1) (I am not considering the result matrix we have to return as result)
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> spiralMatrixIII(int rows, int cols, int rStart, int cStart) {
        vector<vector<int>> directions =  {
                                            {0, 1},  //EAST
                                            {1, 0},  //SOUTH
                                            {0, -1}, //WEST
                                            {-1, 0}  //NORTH
                                          };
        
        vector<vector<int>> result;  
        int step = 0; //how much steps to move
        int dir  = 0; //Which direction

        result.push_back({rStart, cStart});

        while (result.size() < rows * cols) {
            //When we move EAST or WEST, we need to increase our steps by 1
            if (dir == 0 || dir == 2) step++;

            for (int i = 0; i < step; i++) {
                rStart += directions[dir][0];
                cStart += directions[dir][1];

                if (rStart >= 0 && rStart < rows && cStart >= 0 && cStart < cols) // check valid
                    result.push_back({rStart, cStart});
            }

            dir = (dir + 1) % 4; // turn to next direction
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Solution

### Approach 1: Simulation

#### Intuition

Initially, we are located at the coordinates `rStart` and `cStart` and must make our first movement toward the East. Let's simulate the clockwise movement and note the distances moved with each direction to identify any patterns:

- Move 1 unit towards the East.
- Move 1 unit towards the South.
- Move 2 units towards the West.
- Move 2 units towards the North.
- Move 3 units towards the East.
- Move 3 units towards the South.
- Move 4 units towards the West.
- Move 4 units towards the North.
- and so on...

We observe a pattern where distances are covered in pairs of directions, increasing the distance by 1 after each pair. Specifically, we move in the order of East, South, West, and North, increasing the distance after every pair.

To implement this, we can store the directional movements in an array: for instance, East corresponds to `(x+0, y+1)` and South to `(x+1, y+0)`. We then simulate the process by taking two directions simultaneously and increasing the step size after every pair. If the current cell lies within the matrix, we append it to the `traversed` matrix. We return `traversed` once all matrix cells have been covered.

#### Algorithm

1. Initialize an array `dir` with all possible directional movements in the movement.
2. Initialize a matrix `traversed` to store the coordinates of cells.
3. Initialize the integers `step = 1`, `direction = 0` and iterate until all cells have been traversed:
    - Iterate `i` from `0` to `1`:
        - Iterate `j` from `0` to `step - 1`:
            - If `rStart >= 0`, `rStart < rows`, `cStart >= 0`, `cStart < cols`:
                - Append `{rStart,cstart}` to `traversed`.
        - Add `dir[direction][0]` to `rStart` and `dir[direction][1]` to `cStart`.
    - Increment `step` by 1.
4. Return `traversed`.

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> spiralMatrixIII(int rows, int cols, int rStart,
                                        int cStart) {
        // Store all possible directions in an array.
        vector<vector<int>> dir{{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
        vector<vector<int>> traversed;

        // Initial step size is 1, value of d represents the current direction.
        for (int step = 1, direction = 0; traversed.size() < rows * cols;) {
            // direction = 0 -> East, direction = 1 -> South
            // direction = 2 -> West, direction = 3 -> North
            for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
                for (int j = 0; j < step; ++j) {
                    // Validate the current position
                    if (rStart >= 0 && rStart < rows && cStart >= 0 &&
                        cStart < cols) {
                        traversed.push_back({rStart, cStart});
                    }
                    // Make changes to the current position.
                    rStart += dir[direction][0];
                    cStart += dir[direction][1];
                }

                direction = (direction + 1) % 4;
            }
            ++step;
        }
        return traversed;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let rows be the number of rows and cols be the number of columns in the matrix.

- Time complexity: O(max(rows,cols)^2)
    
    We fill the `traversed` matrix with the values on the simulated path. However, we might also move out of the matrix during traversal. The total distance covered depends on max(rows,cols)^2. Can you think of some cases with the worst case time complexity? An example is shown below for the 2x2 matrix:
    
    ![img](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix-iii/Figures/885/example.png)
    
    Therefore, the total time complexity is O(max(rows,cols)^2).
    
- Space complexity: O(rows⋅cols)
    
    Apart from the `traversed` matrix, no additional memory is used. The `traversed` matrix stores all the cells of the matrix, so its size is rows×cols. Therefore, the total space complexity is O(rows⋅cols).
