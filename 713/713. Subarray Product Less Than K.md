### Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than_ `k`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[10,5,2,6], k = 100
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are:
\[10], \[5], \[2], \[6], \[10, 5], \[5, 2], \[2, 6], \[5, 2, 6]
Note that \[10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3], k = 0
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `0 <= k <= 10^6`

**My Implementation**

```cpp
//Approach  : Standard Sliding window Problem
//T.C : O(N)
//S.C : O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        if(k <= 1)
            return 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        int count = 0;
        
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        int prod = 1;
        
        while(right < n){
            prod *= nums[right];
            
            while(prod >= k) {
                prod /= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            
            count += (right-left)+1;
            right++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Overview

We are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`; the task is to count the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than `k`.

**Key Observations:**

1. The problem requires counting valid subarrays, not returning the actual subarrays.
2. The values in the `nums` array are positive.

### Approach 1: Using Sliding Window

#### Intuition

The brute force method involves finding all the subarrays and then selecting those whose products are less than `k`. However, this approach becomes costly in terms of time complexity, reaching O(n2^).

For a more efficient approach, let's use the sliding window pattern. This pattern is applicable when the problem entails achieving a goal using subarrays, and individual elements cannot be independently selected.

The concept behind the sliding window pattern is to maintain a window that continuously expands from the right by adding elements and computing their product until the condition is met. Once the condition is satisfied, we adjust the window by shrinking it from the left until the condition is met again.

As we slide the window across the array, our objective is to identify all subarrays in the `nums` array where the product of its elements remains less than `k`. For each right position, if the product of the window's elements from left to right is less than `k`, adding the element at the right generates new subarrays with products less than `k`.

The count of such subarrays is determined by the difference `right - left + 1`, which represents the number of subarrays that end at `right` and start at any element between `right` and `left`, inclusive. In essence, this count encompasses the subarray consisting solely of the current element itself, as well as all possible subarrays extending back to the left boundary of the window (`left`).

Consider an example window containing elements 3, 4, and 5. If we include 6 in the window, we need to count all possible subarrays that end with 6. These subarrays can be formed by starting at any element within the current window and extending to 6. Therefore, the subarrays would be:

- `[6]` (subarray consisting only of 6)
- `[5, 6]` (subarray starting from 5 and ending at 6)
- `[4, 5, 6]` (subarray starting from 4 and ending at 6)
- `[3, 4, 5, 6]` (subarray starting from 3 and ending at 6)

By calculating `right - left + 1`, we enumerate all subarrays that end with the current element of the window (`nums[right]`). This ensures that we count all possible subarrays as we slide the window across the array. As we can observe, adding element 6 to the window created 4 new subarrays.

The crucial insight is that once the product becomes less than `k`, all possible subarrays formed by selecting subsets of elements within the current window (from left to right) will also have a product strictly less than `k`.

Hence, whenever the product is valid, we add the current window size (`right - left + 1`) to the total count of subarrays.

The following slideshow provides a clearer insight into the underlying approach:

#### Algorithm

- Check if `k` is less than or equal to 1. In this case, no subarrays can have a product less than `k`, so return 0.
- Initialize the variables `totalCount` to 0, to store the final count of subarrays with a product less than `k`, and `product` to 1, representing the product of elements within the window (initially empty).
- Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to define the sliding window. Iterate through the `nums` array using a for loop until `right` reaches the end.
    - Inside the loop, multiply the current `product` by the element at the right pointer (`nums[right]`). This effectively includes the new element in the window.
    - While the current `product` is greater than or equal to `k`, the window needs to shrink to exclude elements that make the product exceed `k`.
        - Divide the `product` by the element at the left pointer (`nums[left]`).
        - Increment `left` by 1 to move the window one position to the right, effectively excluding the leftmost element.
    - Update the `totalCount` by adding the number of valid subarrays with the current window size, which is `right - left + 1`.
- Return the `totalCount`.

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    // Handle edge cases where k is 0 or 1 (no subarrays possible)
    if (k <= 1) return 0;

    int totalCount = 0;
    int product = 1;

    // Use two pointers to maintain a sliding window
    for (int left = 0, right = 0; right < nums.size(); right++) {
      // Expand the window by including the element at the right pointer
      product *= nums[right];

      // Shrink the window from the left while the product is greater than or equal to k
      while (product >= k) {
        // Remove the element at the left pointer from the product
        product /= nums[left++];
      }

      // Update the total count by adding the number of valid subarrays with the current window size
      totalCount += right - left + 1;  // right - left + 1 represents the current window size
    }

    return totalCount;
  }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of `nums`.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    The algorithm iterates through the input array `nums` using a single for loop. Inside the loop, there are nested operations for shrinking the window, but since `left` is incremented a total number of `n` times during the whole array traversal, each element in the array is visited at most twice.
    
    The nested loop terminates when the product becomes less than `k`, and this can only happen at most `n` times total (once for each element). Therefore, the overall time complexity is 2n2n2n, which we describe as O(n).
    
- Space complexity: O(1)
    
    The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like `totalCount`, `product`, `left`, and `right`. These variables do not depend on the size of the input array. Therefore, the space complexity is considered constant, denoted as O(1).
