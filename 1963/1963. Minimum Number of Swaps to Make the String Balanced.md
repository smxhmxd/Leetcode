### Description

You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` of **even** length `n`. The string consists of **exactly** `n / 2` opening brackets `'['` and `n / 2` closing brackets `']'`.

A string is called **balanced** if and only if:

- It is the empty string, or
- It can be written as `AB`, where both `A` and `B` are **balanced** strings, or
- It can be written as `[C]`, where `C` is a **balanced** string.

You may swap the brackets at **any** two indices **any** number of times.

Return _the **minimum** number of swaps to make_ `s` _**balanced**_.

**Example 1:**

```cpp
Input: s = "][]["
Output: 1
Explanation: You can make the string balanced by swapping index 0 with index 3.
The resulting string is "[[]]".
```

**Example 2:**

```cpp
Input: s = "]]][[["
Output: 2
Explanation: You can do the following to make the string balanced:
- Swap index 0 with index 4. s = "[]][][".
- Swap index 1 with index 5. s = "[[][]]".
The resulting string is "[[][]]".
```

**Example 3:**

```cpp
Input: s = "[]"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string is already balanced.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == s.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^6`
- `n` is even.
- `s[i]` is either `'['` or `']'`.
- The number of opening brackets `'['` equals `n / 2`, and the number of closing brackets `']'` equals `n / 2`.

**My Implementation**

```cpp
//Approach-1 (Using stack)
//T.C : O(n)
//S.C : O(n)
class Solution {
public:
    int minSwaps(string s) {
        stack<char> st;
        
        for(char &ch : s) {
            if(ch == '[')
                st.push(ch);
            else if(!st.empty())
                st.pop();
        }
        
        return (st.size()+1)/2;
    }
};


//Approach-2 (without using stack)
//T.C : O(n)
//S.C : O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    int minSwaps(string s) {
        int size = 0;
        
        for(char &ch : s) {
            if(ch == '[')      
              size++;
            else if(size != 0)
              size--;
        }
        
        return (size+1)/2;
    }
};
```

### Approach 1: Stack

#### Intuition

We are given a 0-indexed string `s` of even length `n` made up of `n/2` opening brackets `[` and `n/2` closing brackets `]`. Our task is to return the minimum number of swaps to make the string balanced.

Balanced parentheses mean that every opening bracket `[` has a matching closing bracket `]` in the correct order. Unbalanced parentheses occur when there are more closing brackets `]` than opening brackets `[` at some point in the string.

There are two key points to keep in mind:

1. Swapping balanced brackets won't help. If you swap characters in a balanced pair like `[]`, it becomes `][`, which makes the string unbalanced. So, this type of swap increases the problem instead of solving it.
2. Swapping unbalanced brackets can fix the string. If a closing bracket `]` appears before its matching opening bracket `[`, a swap between an unbalanced `]` and an unbalanced `[` will balance one pair.

What is the maximum number of brackets that you can balance with a single swap? The answer is 2 for all parentheses of the form `][`. Therefore, the optimal approach is to swap unbalanced parentheses with each other. Since 2 unbalanced parentheses are made balanced with a single swap, the total number of swaps to balance are given by `unbalanced / 2`.

Let's understand this with an example:

For the string `]]][[[`,

There are total 3 mismatches in the string. Now, we need to swap the `]` and `[` at index `0` and `5` respectively.

The string is now given by `[]][[]`. There is 1 mismatch in the string. So, swap `]` and `[` at index `2` and `3` respectively. This swap reduced exactly 2 mismatches.

The string is balanced and given by `[][][]`. Therefore, it requires exactly 2 swaps to balance the string.

To solve the problem, we can use a stack to keep track of unmatched opening brackets `[` as we move through the string. Each time we find a closing bracket `]`, we check if there’s an unmatched opening bracket `[` on the stack. If there is, we remove it, as we’ve found a match and balanced the pair. If the stack is empty when we encounter a closing bracket `]`, this bracket is unbalanced.

We count how many unbalanced closing brackets `]` we find. After traversing the string, the number of unbalanced `]` brackets tells us how many swaps are needed. Each swap fixes two brackets—one unbalanced `[` and one unbalanced `]`. So, the minimum number of swaps is half the total number of unbalanced closing brackets.

#### Algorithm

1. Initialize a `stack` to keep track of unmatched opening brackets `[` and an integer `unbalanced` to count unbalanced closing brackets `]`.
2. Traverse the string `s` character by character:
    - If the current character is an opening bracket `[`, push it onto the `stack`.
    - If the current character is a closing bracket `]`:
        - Check if the `stack` is not empty:
            - If it is not empty, pop the top element from the `stack`.
            - If the `stack` is empty, increment the `unbalanced` counter.
3. Return the result as the minimum number of swaps required to balance the string. The minimum number of swaps is calculated as `(unbalanced + 1) / 2`.

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSwaps(string s) {
        stack<char> stack;
        int unbalanced = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            char ch = s[i];
            // If an opening bracket is encountered, push it in the stack.
            if (ch == '[')
                stack.push(ch);
            else {
                // If the stack is not empty, pop it.
                if (!stack.empty()) stack.pop();
                // Otherwise increase the count of unbalanced brackets.
                else
                    unbalanced++;
            }
        }
        return (unbalanced + 1) / 2;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the size of the given string `s`.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    We iterate through each character of the string exactly once in the loop. Each push or pop operation on the stack takes constant time O(1). Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n).
    
- Space complexity: O(n)
    
    In the worst case, we may end up pushing all opening brackets `[` into the stack, so the space used by the stack can go up to O(n). Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).

### Approach 2: Space-Optimized Stack

#### Intuition

We only need to count the unbalanced opening brackets `[` that don't have matching closing brackets `]`. This helps us figure out how many swaps are needed. Instead of using a stack, we can track the number of unmatched brackets with an integer, which saves space.

The `stackSize` represents the number of unmatched `[` brackets as we go through the string. When we encounter a closing bracket `]`, we try to balance it by reducing `stackSize` if there’s already an unmatched opening bracket (i.e., `stackSize` > 0).

After the loop, the value of `stackSize` will show how many opening brackets are still unmatched. These remaining `[` brackets need to be balanced with closing brackets by performing swaps. Each swap balances two brackets (one `[` and one `]`), so the minimum number of swaps is `(stackSize + 1) / 2`.

#### Algorithm

1. Initialize `stackSize` to 0. This integer will keep track of the number of unmatched opening brackets `[`.
2. For each character `ch` in the string `s`:
    - If `ch` is an opening bracket `[`, increment `stackSize` by 1.
    - If `ch` is a closing bracket `]`:
        - Check if `stackSize` is greater than 0:
            - If true, decrement `stackSize` by 1 (indicating a matching opening bracket has been found).
            - If false, do nothing (this indicates an unbalanced closing bracket `]`).
3. Return the result as the minimum number of swaps required to balance the string. The minimum number of swaps is calculated as `(stackSize+1)/2`.

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSwaps(string s) {
        int stackSize = 0;
        int n = s.size();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            char ch = s[i];
            // If character is opening bracket, increment the stack size.
            if (ch == '[')
                stackSize++;
            else {
                // If the character is closing bracket, and we have an opening
                // bracket, decrease the stack size.
                if (stackSize > 0) stackSize--;
            }
        }
        return (stackSize + 1) / 2;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the size of the given string `s`.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    We iterate through each character of the string exactly once in the loop. Each increment or decrement operation on the `stackSize` variable takes constant time O(1). Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n).
    
- Space complexity: O(1)
    
    We only use a single integer (`stackSize`) to keep track of unmatched opening brackets, which means the space complexity is constant. Thus, the space complexity is O(1).
