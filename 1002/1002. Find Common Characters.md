### Description

Given a string array `words`, return _an array of all characters that show up in all strings within the_ `words` _(including duplicates)_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = ["bella","label","roller"]
**Output:** ["e","l","l"]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = ["cool","lock","cook"]
**Output:** ["c","o"]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

**My Implementation**

```cpp
//Approach (Simple iteration)
//T.C : O(n*w) , w = average length of each word. and n = number of words
//S.C : O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    void fillCountArray(string &word, int count[26]) {
        for(char &ch : word) {
            count[ch-'a']++;
        }
    }
    vector<string> commonChars(vector<string>& words) {
        vector<string> result;
        
        int n = words.size();
        
        int count[26] = {0};
        
        fillCountArray(words[0], count);

        for(int i = 1; i<n; i++) {
            int temp[26] = {0};
            
            fillCountArray(words[i], temp);

            for(int i = 0; i<26; i++) {
                if(count[i] != temp[i])
                    count[i] = min(count[i], temp[i]);
            }
            
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i<26; i++) {
            if(count[i] != 0) {
                int c = count[i];
                while(c--) {
                    result.push_back(string(1, i+'a'));
                }
            }
        }
        // the 1 indicates how many numbers the element will be repeated
        // for(1, a) it will return a
        // for(2, a) it will return aa and so on
        // The line i + 'a' will convert the no to its lowercase alphabet equivalent
        
        return result;
    }
};

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a map to store the frequency of characters in each string. To start with, let's take a few example strings and analyze their character frequencies.

**Consider the following strings:**

1. "belle"
2. "label"
3. "roller"

> For "**belle**", the character frequency map will be:

- 'b' is present 1 time
- 'e' is present 2 times
- 'l' is present 2 times

|Character|Frequency|
|---|---|
|b|1|
|e|2|
|l|2|

> For "**label**", the character frequency map will be:

- 'l' is present 2 times
- 'a' is present 1 time
- 'b' is present 1 time
- 'e' is present 1 time

|Character|Frequency|
|---|---|
|l|2|
|a|1|
|b|1|
|e|1|

> For "**roller**", the character frequency map will be:

- 'r' is present 2 times
- 'o' is present 1 time
- 'l' is present 2 times
- 'e' is present 1 time

|Character|Frequency|
|---|---|
|r|2|
|o|1|
|l|2|
|e|1|

**Next, we compare the frequencies across all maps to determine the minimum frequency of each character that appears in all strings.**

- 'b' appears 1 time in "belle", 1 time in "label", and 0 times in "roller". The minimum frequency is 0, so 'b' is not included in the final result.
- 'e' appears 2 times in "belle", 1 time in "label", and 1 time in "roller". The minimum frequency is 1, so 'e' is included 1 time.
- 'l' appears 2 times in "belle", 2 times in "label", and 2 times in "roller". The minimum frequency is 2, so 'l' is included 2 times.
- 'a' appears 0 times in "belle", 1 time in "label", and 0 times in "roller". The minimum frequency is 0, so 'a' is not included in the final result.
- 'r' appears 0 times in "belle", 0 times in "label", and 2 times in "roller". The minimum frequency is 0, so 'r' is not included in the final result.
- 'o' appears 0 times in "belle", 0 times in "label", and 1 time in "roller". The minimum frequency is 0, so 'o' is not included in the final result.

**Here's how we going to code it up:**

- We going to first, initalise an array of size 26 to zero.
- Then we going to, iterate over each string and update the character frequency counts in the array.
- Now we have to compare the frequency counts across all strings and find the minimum frequency for each character.
- The final result using the minimum frequencies.

**Let's code it UP**

**C++**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> commonChars(vector<string>& words) {
        vector<int> minFreq(26, INT_MAX);

        for (const string& word : words) {
            vector<int> charCount(26, 0);
            for (char c : word) {
                charCount[c - 'a']++;
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                minFreq[i] = min(minFreq[i], charCount[i]);
            }
        }

        vector<string> result;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            while (minFreq[i] > 0) {
                result.push_back(string(1, i + 'a'));
                minFreq[i]--;
            }
        }
        // the 1 indicates how many numbers the element will be repeated
        // for(1, a) it will return a
        // for(2, a) it will return aa and so on
        // The line i + 'a' will convert the no to its lowercase alphabet equivalent

        return result;
    }
};
```
