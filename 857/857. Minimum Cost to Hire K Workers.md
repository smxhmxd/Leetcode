### Description

There are `n` workers. You are given two integer arrays `quality` and `wage` where `quality[i]` is the quality of the `ith` worker and `wage[i]` is the minimum wage expectation for the `ith` worker.

We want to hire exactly `k` workers to form a **paid group**. To hire a group of `k` workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:

1. Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
2. In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality. This means if a worker’s quality is double that of another worker in the group, then they must be paid twice as much as the other worker.

Given the integer `k`, return _the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions_. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], k = 2
**Output:** 105.00000
**Explanation:** We pay 70 to 0th worker and 35 to 2nd worker.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** quality = [3,1,10,10,1], wage = [4,8,2,2,7], k = 3
**Output:** 30.66667
**Explanation:** We pay 4 to 0th worker, 13.33333 to 2nd and 3rd workers separately.

**Constraints:**

- `n == quality.length == wage.length`
- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`
- `1 <= quality[i], wage[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution

### Overview

We need to hire exactly `k` workers from a pool of `n` workers. Each worker has a quality and a minimum wage expectation. The goal is to form a paid group while satisfying two conditions:

1. Each worker in the paid group must receive at least their minimum wage expectation.
    
2. Each worker in the paid group should be paid in proportion to their quality relative to other workers in the group.
    

How do we determine the workers' wages based on these conditions?

Suppose we have 2 workers `i` and `j`,

`wage[i]/wage[j] = quality[i]/quality[j]`​

`wage[i]/quality[i] = wage[j]/quality[j]`​

Meaning if a worker’s quality is double that of another worker in the group, then they must be paid twice as much as the other worker.

Consider the first example(k=2) from the problem description:

> **Input:** quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], k = 2

To start, let's say we hire workers `0` and `2`. Their combined quality is 15 units (10+5). Now, we allocate payment based on their contribution to this total quality:

Worker `0` will be paid as follows: `10/15 = 2/3 = individual quality/total quality`​.

Worker `2` will be paid as follows: `5/15 = 1/3 = individual quality/total quality`​..

We use this to meet condition 2: Workers are compensated in proportion to their quality relative to other workers in the group i.e., worker `0` receives `2/3​` of the total payment, and Worker `2` receives `1/3`​.

Worker `0` has the higher minimum wage, $70. We can set up the following proportion to determine x, the amount of money worker `2` will make:

### Approach: Priority Queue

#### Intuition

Our goal is to minimize the total cost of hiring exactly `k` workers. The cost of hiring a worker depends on two factors: the worker's quality and the ratio of their wage to their quality (wage-to-quality ratio).

First, we observe that hiring workers with lower wage-to-quality ratios could potentially lead to a lower overall cost. This observation motivates us to sort the workers based on their wage-to-quality ratios in ascending order. By doing so, we can consider the workers with the lowest ratios first, which are the most cost-effective options.

However, we also need to keep track of the qualities of the workers we have hired so far. This is because the total cost is calculated as the sum of the products of each worker's quality and their wage-to-quality ratio. We can use a priority queue (max heap) data structure to efficiently manage the worker qualities. The priority queue will always maintain the `k` workers with the lowest qualities, allowing us to calculate the total cost for the current set of `k` workers.

Now, we can iterate through the sorted list of workers. For each worker, we add their quality to the priority queue and update the sum of qualities in the priority queue. If the size of the priority queue exceeds `k`, we remove the worker with the highest quality to maintain a size of `k`.

Once the priority queue contains exactly `k` workers, we can calculate the total cost for the current set of workers by multiplying each worker's quality by their wage-to-quality ratio and summing the products. If this cost is lower than the current minimum cost, we update the result.

> **Note:** The above explanation is sufficient to understand the solution to the problem. We've included the explanation using mathematical logic for an alternate representation.

#### Algorithm

- Initialize variables `n` to store the size of the input arrays (`quality` and `wage`), `totalCost` to store the minimum total cost (initially set to the maximum possible value) and `currentTotalQuality` to keep track of the sum of qualities of the current set of workers.
- Create a array `wageToQualityRatio` to store the wage-to-quality ratio and the quality of each worker as pairs.
- Calculate the wage-to-quality ratio for each worker and store it in `wageToQualityRatio`.
- Sort `wageToQualityRatio` in ascending order based on the wage-to-quality ratio.
- Create a priority queue `highestQualityWorkers` (max heap) to store the workers with the highest qualities.
- Iterate through the sorted `wageToQualityRatio`:
    - Push the current worker's quality to `highestQualityWorkers`.
    - Update `currentTotalQuality` by adding the current worker's quality.
    - If the size of `highestQualityWorkers` exceeds `k`:
        - Remove the worker with the highest quality from `highestQualityWorkers`.
        - Update `currentTotalQuality` by subtracting the removed worker's quality.
    - If the size of `highestQualityWorkers` is equal to `k`:
        - Calculate the total cost for the current set of workers by multiplying `currentTotalQuality` by the wage-to-quality ratio of the current worker.
        - Update `totalCost` if the calculated cost is smaller than the current minimum cost.
- After iterating through all workers, return `totalCost`, which holds the minimum total cost for hiring `k` workers.
- Return `totalCost`.

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double mincostToHireWorkers(vector<int>& quality, vector<int>& wage, int k) {
        int n = quality.size();
        double totalCost = numeric_limits<double>::max();
        double currentTotalQuality = 0;
        // Store wage-to-quality ratio along with quality
        vector<pair<double, int>> wageToQualityRatio;

        // Calculate wage-to-quality ratio for each worker
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            wageToQualityRatio.push_back(
                {static_cast<double>(wage[i]) / quality[i], quality[i]});
        }

        // Sort workers based on their wage-to-quality ratio
        sort(wageToQualityRatio.begin(), wageToQualityRatio.end());

        // Use a priority queue to keep track of the highest quality workers
        priority_queue<int> highestQualityWorkers;

        // Iterate through workers
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            highestQualityWorkers.push(wageToQualityRatio[i].second);
            currentTotalQuality += wageToQualityRatio[i].second;

            // If we have more than k workers,
            // remove the one with the highest quality
            if (highestQualityWorkers.size() > k) {
                currentTotalQuality -= highestQualityWorkers.top();
                highestQualityWorkers.pop();
            }

            // If we have exactly k workers,
            // calculate the total cost and update if it's the minimum
            if (highestQualityWorkers.size() == k) {
                totalCost = min(totalCost, currentTotalQuality *
                                               wageToQualityRatio[i].first);
            }
        }
        return totalCost;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of workers and k be the size of the priority queue (bounded by `k`).

- Time complexity: O(nlog⁡n+nlog⁡k)
    
    Sorting the workers based on their wage-to-quality ratio takes O(nlog⁡n).
    
    Each worker is processed once, and for each worker, we perform push/pop operations on the priority queue, which takes O(log⁡k), so processing the workers takes O(nlog⁡k).
    
    So, the total time complexity is O(nlog⁡n+nlog⁡k), which is dominated by the sorting step when `k` is much smaller than `n`.
    
- Space complexity: O(n+k)
