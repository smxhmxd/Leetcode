### Description

There are some robots and factories on the X-axis. You are given an integer array `robot` where `robot[i]` is the position of the `ith` robot. You are also given a 2D integer array `factory` where `factory[j] = [positionj, limitj]` indicates that `positionj` is the position of the `jth` factory and that the `jth` factory can repair at most `limitj` robots.

The positions of each robot are **unique**. The positions of each factory are also **unique**. Note that a robot can be **in the same position** as a factory initially.

All the robots are initially broken; they keep moving in one direction. The direction could be the negative or the positive direction of the X-axis. When a robot reaches a factory that did not reach its limit, the factory repairs the robot, and it stops moving.

**At any moment**, you can set the initial direction of moving for **some** robot. Your target is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the robots.

Return _the minimum total distance traveled by all the robots_. The test cases are generated such that all the robots can be repaired.

**Note that**

- All robots move at the same speed.
- If two robots move in the same direction, they will never collide.
- If two robots move in opposite directions and they meet at some point, they do not collide. They cross each other.
- If a robot passes by a factory that reached its limits, it crosses it as if it does not exist.
- If the robot moved from a position `x` to a position `y`, the distance it moved is `|y - x|`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/15/example1.jpg)

```cpp
Input: robot = [0,4,6], factory = [[2,2],[6,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: As shown in the figure:
- The first robot at position 0 moves in the positive direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
- The second robot at position 4 moves in the negative direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
- The third robot at position 6 will be repaired at the second factory. It does not need to move.
The limit of the first factory is 2, and it fixed 2 robots.
The limit of the second factory is 2, and it fixed 1 robot.
The total distance is |2 - 0| + |2 - 4| + |6 - 6| = 4. It can be shown that we cannot achieve a better total distance than 4.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/15/example-2.jpg)

```cpp
Input: robot = [1,-1], factory = [[-2,1],[2,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: As shown in the figure:
- The first robot at position 1 moves in the positive direction. It will be repaired at the second factory.
- The second robot at position -1 moves in the negative direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
The limit of the first factory is 1, and it fixed 1 robot.
The limit of the second factory is 1, and it fixed 1 robot.
The total distance is |2 - 1| + |(-2) - (-1)| = 2. It can be shown that we cannot achieve a better total distance than 2.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= robot.length, factory.length <= 100`
- `factory[j].length == 2`
- `-10^9 <= robot[i], positionj <= 10^9`
- `0 <= limitj <= robot.length`
- The input will be generated such that it is always possible to repair every robot.

**My Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumTotalDistance(vector<int>& robot,
                                   vector<vector<int>>& factory) {
        // Sort robots and factories by position
        sort(robot.begin(), robot.end());
        sort(factory.begin(), factory.end());

        // Flatten factory positions according to their capacities
        vector<int> factoryPositions;
        for (auto& f : factory)
            for (int i = 0; i < f[1]; i++) factoryPositions.push_back(f[0]);

        int robotCount = robot.size(), factoryCount = factoryPositions.size();
        vector<vector<long long>> dp(robotCount + 1,
                                     vector<long long>(factoryCount + 1, 0));

        // Initialize base cases
        for (int i = 0; i < robotCount; i++)
            dp[i][factoryCount] = 1e12;  // No factories left

        // Fill DP table bottom-up
        for (int i = robotCount - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = factoryCount - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                // Option 1: Assign current robot to current factory
                long long assign =
                    abs(robot[i] - factoryPositions[j]) + dp[i + 1][j + 1];

                // Option 2: Skip current factory for the current robot
                long long skip = dp[i][j + 1];

                dp[i][j] = min(assign, skip);  // Take the minimum option
            }
        }
        // Minimum distance starting from first robot and factory
        return dp[0][0];
    }
};
```
