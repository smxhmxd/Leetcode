### Description

Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` _if_ `word` _exists in the grid_.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/word-1.jpg)

**Input:** board = \[\["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/15/word3.jpg)

**Input:** board = \[\["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

- `m == board.length`
- `n = board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 6`
- `1 <= word.length <= 15`
- `board` and `word` consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

**My Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int l, m, n;
    vector<vector<int>> directions{{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};
    bool find(vector<vector<char>>& board, int i, int j, string &word, int idx) {
        if(idx >= l)
            return true;
        
        if(i < 0 || i >= m || j < 0 || j >= n || board[i][j] != word[idx])
            return false;
        
        char temp = board[i][j];
        board[i][j] = '$';
        
        for(auto& dir : directions) {
            int i_ = i + dir[0];
            int j_ = j + dir[1];
            
            if(find(board, i_, j_, word, idx+1))
                return true;
        }
        
        board[i][j] = temp;
        return false;
    }
    
    bool exist(vector<vector<char>>& board, string word) {
        m = board.size();
        n = board[0].size();
        l = word.length();
        if(m*n < l)
            return false;
        
        for(int i = 0; i<m; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j<n; j++) {
                if(board[i][j] == word[0] && find(board, i, j, word, 0)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```

# Intuition

 The problem can be solved by traversing the grid and performing a depth-first search (DFS) for each possible starting position. At each cell, we check if the current character matches the corresponding character of the word. If it does, we explore all four directions (up, down, left, right) recursively until we find the complete word or exhaust all possibilities.

---

# Approach

 1. Implement a recursive function `backtrack` that takes the current position `(i, j)` in the grid and the current index `k` of the word.

 2.Base cases:

-  If `k` equals the length of the word, return `True`, indicating that the word has been found.
    
-  If the current position `(i, j)` is out of the grid boundaries or the character at `(i, j)` does not match the character at index `k` of the word, return `False`.
    

 3.Mark the current cell as visited by changing its value or marking it as empty.

 4. Recursively explore all four directions (up, down, left, right) by calling `backtrack` with updated positions `(i+1, j), (i-1, j), (i, j+1), and (i, j-1)`.

 5.If any recursive call returns `True`, indicating that the word has been found, return `True`.

 6. If none of the recursive calls returns `True`, reset the current cell to its original value and return `False`.

 7. Iterate through all cells in the grid and call the `backtrack` function for each cell. If any call returns `True`, return `True`, indicating that the word exists in the grid. Otherwise, return `False`.

# Complexity

- ## Time complexity:
    

 O(m∗n∗4^l), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid and l is the length of the word. The 4^l factor represents the maximum number of recursive calls we may have to make for each starting cell.

- ## Space complexity:
    

 O(l), where l is the length of the word. The space complexity is primarily due to the recursive stack depth during the DFS traversal.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool exist(vector<vector<char>>& board, string word) {
        int m = board.size();
        int n = board[0].size();
        
        function<bool(int, int, int)> backtrack = [&](int i, int j, int k) {
            if (k == word.length()) {
                return true;
            }
            if (i < 0 || i >= m || j < 0 || j >= n || board[i][j] != word[k]) {
                return false;
            }
            
            char temp = board[i][j];
            board[i][j] = '\0';
            
            if (backtrack(i + 1, j, k + 1) || backtrack(i - 1, j, k + 1) || 
                backtrack(i, j + 1, k + 1) || backtrack(i, j - 1, k + 1)) {
                return true;
            }
            
            board[i][j] = temp; 
            return false;
        };
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {

                if (backtrack(i, j, 0)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
