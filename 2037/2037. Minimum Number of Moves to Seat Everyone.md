### Description

There are `n` seats and `n` students in a room. You are given an array `seats` of length `n`, where `seats[i]` is the position of the `ith` seat. You are also given the array `students` of length `n`, where `students[j]` is the position of the `jth` student.

You may perform the following move any number of times:

- Increase or decrease the position of the `ith` student by `1` (i.e., moving the `ith` student from position `x` to `x + 1` or `x - 1`)

Return _the **minimum number of moves** required to move each student to a seat_ _such that no two students are in the same seat._

Note that there may be **multiple** seats or students in the **same** position at the beginning.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** seats = [3,1,5], students = [2,7,4]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is moved from from position 2 to position 1 using 1 move.
- The second student is moved from from position 7 to position 5 using 2 moves.
- The third student is moved from from position 4 to position 3 using 1 move.
In total, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 moves were used.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** seats = [4,1,5,9], students = [1,3,2,6]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is not moved.
- The second student is moved from from position 3 to position 4 using 1 move.
- The third student is moved from from position 2 to position 5 using 3 moves.
- The fourth student is moved from from position 6 to position 9 using 3 moves.
In total, 0 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 moves were used.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** seats = [2,2,6,6], students = [1,3,2,6]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Note that there are two seats at position 2 and two seats at position 6.
The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is moved from from position 1 to position 2 using 1 move.
- The second student is moved from from position 3 to position 6 using 3 moves.
- The third student is not moved.
- The fourth student is not moved.
In total, 1 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 4 moves were used.

**Constraints:**

- `n == seats.length == students.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= seats[i], students[j] <= 100`

```cpp
//Approach-1 (Using Counting Sort)
//T.C : O(n+m)
//S.C : O(m)
class Solution {
public:
    int minMovesToSeat(vector<int>& seats, vector<int>& students) {
        int n = students.size();
        vector<int> position_seat(101, 0);
        vector<int> position_stud(101, 0);

        for(int &x : seats) {
            position_seat[x]++;
        }
        for(int &x : students) {
            position_stud[x]++;
        }

        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int result = 0;

        while(i <= 100 && j <= 100) {
            if(position_seat[i] == 0) i++;
            if(position_stud[j] == 0) j++;
            
            if(i <= 100 && j <= 100 && position_seat[i] != 0 && position_stud[j] != 0) {
                result += abs(i-j);
                position_seat[i]--;
                position_stud[j]--;
                n--;
            }
        }

        return result;

    }
};

//Approach-2 (Using sorting)
//T.C : O(nlogn)
//S.C : O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    int minMovesToSeat(vector<int>& seats, vector<int>& students) {
        sort(begin(seats), end(seats));
        sort(begin(students), end(students));

        int moves = 0;

        int n = seats.size();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            moves += abs(seats[i] - students[i]);
        }

        return moves;
    }

# Approach 1 - Sorting

# Intuition

In each step we want to find a student , closest to a position , so that student have to move minimum positions.

# Approach

We sort both the arrays , so that we can get the minimum positions as well as the students nearest to the minimum position.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n log(n))`
    
- Space complexity:`O(log(n))` (_for recursive stack calls_)
    

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minMovesToSeat(vector<int>& seats, vector<int>& students) {
        sort(seats.begin(),seats.end());
        sort(students.begin(),students.end());
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<seats.size();i++){
            ans+=abs(seats[i]-students[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

# Approach 2 - Priority Queue

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n log(n))`
    
- Space complexity:`O(n)` (_each priority queue will store n elements_)
    
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minMovesToSeat(vector<int>& seats, vector<int>& students) {
        int ans = 0;
        priority_queue<int> pq , student;
        for(int i=0;i<seats.size();i++){
            pq.push(seats[i]);
            student.push(students[i]);
        }
        for(int i=0;i<seats.size();i++){
            int a = pq.top();
            int b = student.top();
            pq.pop();
            student.pop();
            ans+=abs(a-b);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

# Approach 3 - Counting sort (O(n))

---

# Intuition

The main idea is to take advantage of the fact that the seat and student positions are bounded between 1 and 100. This allows us to use a counting sort approach, which can be more efficient than comparison-based sorting for small ranges. By counting the occurrences of each seat and student position, we can then match them in a way that minimizes the movement.

# Approach

1. **Count Occurrences**: Create arrays to count the occurrences of each position for both seats and students.
2. **Match Positions**: Iterate through the counted positions and match students to seats while minimizing the total moves.
3. **Calculate Moves**: For each matching, calculate the absolute difference and sum it up.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n+k)` (_k = 100 , making it O(n) effectively_)
    
- Space complexity:`O(k)` (_k = 100 , making it O(1) effectively_)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minMovesToSeat(std::vector<int>& seats, std::vector<int>& students) {
        const int maxPosition = 100;
        std::vector<int> seatCount(maxPosition + 1, 0);
        std::vector<int> studentCount(maxPosition + 1, 0);
        
        for (int seat : seats) {
            seatCount[seat]++;
        }
        
        for (int student : students) {
            studentCount[student]++;
        }
        
        int seatIdx = 0;
        int studentIdx = 0;
        int moves = 0;
        
        while (seatIdx <= maxPosition && studentIdx <= maxPosition) {
            while (seatIdx <= maxPosition && seatCount[seatIdx] == 0) {
                seatIdx++;
            }
            while (studentIdx <= maxPosition && studentCount[studentIdx] == 0) {
                studentIdx++;
            }
            
            if (seatIdx <= maxPosition && studentIdx <= maxPosition) {
                int count = std::min(seatCount[seatIdx], studentCount[studentIdx]);
                moves += count * std::abs(seatIdx - studentIdx);
                seatCount[seatIdx] -= count;
                studentCount[studentIdx] -= count;
            }
        }
        
        return moves;
    }
};
```
