### Description

In a town, there are `n` people labeled from `1` to `n`. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

1.  The town judge trusts nobody.
2.  Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3.  There is exactly one person that satisfies properties **1** and **2**.

You are given an array `trust` where `trust[i] = [ai, bi]` representing that the person labeled `ai` trusts the person labeled `bi`. If a trust relationship does not exist in `trust` array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.

Return _the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return_ `-1` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2, trust = \[\[1,2\]\]
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, trust = \[\[1,3\],\[2,3\]\]
**Output:** 3

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 3, trust = \[\[1,3\],\[2,3\],\[3,1\]\]
**Output:** -1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 1000`
*   `0 <= trust.length <= 10^4`
*   `trust[i].length == 2`
*   All the pairs of `trust` are **unique**.
*   `ai != bi`
*   `1 <= ai, bi <= n`

**My Implementation**

```cpp
//Approach-1 (Using Indegree and Outdegree)
class Solution {
public:
    int findJudge(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {
        vector<int> indegree(n+1);
        vector<int> outdegree(n+1);
        
        for(vector<int> &vec : trust) {
            indegree[vec[1]]++;
            outdegree[vec[0]]++;
        }
        
        for(int i = 1; i<n+1; i++) {
            if(indegree[i] == n-1 && outdegree[i] == 0)
                return i;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
};


//Approach-2 (Using Single Count array)
class Solution {
public:
    int findJudge(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {
        vector<int> count(n+1);
        
        for(vector<int> &vec : trust) {
            count[vec[0]]--;
            count[vec[1]]++;
        }
        
        for(int i = 1; i<n+1; i++) {
            if(count[i] == n-1)
                return i;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```

**Method 1- Using 2 vector**

## Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Two vectors, `trusting` and `trusted`, are initialized to keep track of trust relationships.
    
2. **Loop and Count**: Iterate through the trust relationships, updating counts of trust and being trusted.
    
3. **Find the Judge**: Check if there exists a person who is trusted by all others and trusts no one.
    
4. **Return Result**: Return the index of the judge if found, otherwise return -1.
    

**Time Complexity: O(E + N)** `E is the number of trust relationships.`  
**Space Complexity: O(2N)**  
**C++**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findJudge(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {  
	 // Arrays to track trust given and received
        vector<int> trusting(n + 1, 0);   
        vector<int> trusted(n + 1, 0);     
        for (auto i : trust) {                    
        // Count trust relationships
            trusting[i[0]]++;                    
            // Increment trust given
            trusted[i[1]]++;                    
            // Increment trust received
        }
        int ans = -1;                            
        // Initialize result
                       
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)           
        // Find the person trusted by everyone else
            if (trusting[i] == 0 && trusted[i] == n - 1){ 
                ans = i;             
                // Update result
            }
        return ans;                
        // Return judge's index or -1 if not found
    }
};
```

**Method 2-Using single vector**

1. **Initialization**: A vector `V` is initialized to represent the net trust count for each person.
    
2. **Loop and Update Trust Count**: Iterate through trust relationships, updating trust counts based on who trusts and is trusted.
    
3. **Find the Judge**: Check if there exists a person with a net trust count of `n - 1` (trusted by everyone else). Return their index as the judge.
    
4. **Return Result**: Return the judge's index if found, otherwise return -1.
    

**Time Complexity: O(E + N)** `E is the number of trust relationships.`  
**Space Complexity: O(N)**  
**C++**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findJudge(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {
        vector<int> trustcount(n + 1, 0); 

        // Count trust relationships
        for (const auto& relation : trust) {
            trustcount[relation[0]]--;  
            trustcount[relation[1]]++;  
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {       
        // Check if there is a person who is trusted by everyone else
            if (trustcount[i] == n - 1) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;    // If no such person found, return -1
    }
};
```
