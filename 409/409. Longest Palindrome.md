### Description

Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the **longest** 

**palindrome**

 that can be built with those letters.

Letters are **case sensitive**, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abccccdd"
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "a"
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
- `s` consists of lowercase **and/or** uppercase English letters only.

**My Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestPalindrome(string s) {

      unordered_map<char, int> count;
      int n = s.length();
      int ans = 0;
      bool isOdd = false;

    // for(auto i : s) count[i]++;
      for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
        count[s[i]]++;
      }

    // Iterate over the map
    // for (auto& pair : count) {
    //     char key = pair.first;   // Access the key
    //     int value = pair.second; // Access the value

    for(auto [key, value] : count) {
        if(value % 2 == 0) {
            ans += value;
        }
        else
        {
        ans += value - 1; // for handling cases like 'ccc' or 'cccddd'
        isOdd = true;
    }
    }
    return (isOdd) ? ans+1 : ans;
    }
};
```

We will have a string, using that characters from the string. We have to tell that. How much longest length palindrome is possible.  
And we have to return that longest length.

What is **Palindrome**?

> For example we have given a character, `a` if you read it from left to right or right to left. It going to meant the same thing!

- Because **left to right**, we will read it will be **ab**
- But from **right to left**, we will read it will be **ba**
- Hence, it's not

**Approach - 1**

So, we don't have to check whether it is palindrome or not! We have to return that, using that string character, how long palindrome can we make!  
Let's take one example,

```javascript
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
```

What will be the longest palindrome, can we make using this string **s**. We can use it's character in any order. And we have to return the longest length. We don't have to make it, we just have to return the length!

Let;s have few palindrome first,

```
aabb
abba
accca
aaabaaa
```

Now, if you carefully notice that. These are only making palindrome, as if the frequency of a character is in **even number**!  
![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/82e7d1af-cebc-4b6f-b0b5-3916f6c32420_1717460944.1859243.png)

But, this isn't true, because if you look at other examples you will see that, the frequency of other characters in other strings are **odd too**  
![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/c92cd3fb-fc1e-47a7-a35c-a2bd2434e7e4_1717461094.39627.png)

So, what this thing conclude! Can both **even** and **odd** frequency makes a palindrome, ahhhh NO!  
Let's understand with one more example!  
![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/b5e29e65-b1a3-4262-a23d-abaa8170eaba_1717461366.975243.png)

Now in this above, example you can see that

- `a` has 4 characters, `b` has 1 character and `c` has 3 characters
- So, the only palindrome can be possible is, on the outer side we got even characters and in the middle or in the inner we have only **1 odd** character present. It's frequency doesn't matter, but to be a palindrome. It has to be 1 only!
- See what I'm saying, This is one possible palindrome  
    ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/bb9b2708-e3ce-4ad1-8458-76843ced2310_1717461532.689692.png)And this is another one possible palindrome![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/6da1bb42-89ad-4011-b914-adcfc47680e0_1717461588.7535245.png)

Now, from this what we can conclude is :

- Either give us all **even** frequency characters
- Or, give us **even** + **odd (frequency character has to be 1 only)**

Now let's try to solve this problem, using the given example!

- First, we going to create it's frequency map!  
    ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/88582be6-52be-440b-b820-f17a852fb69d_1717461891.5485165.png)

Now, from this **frequency map**, how many **even** characters and **one odd** character we can take!

- `c` is **4**
- `d` is **2**
- Now from `a`**/**`b` we can choose anyone as there frequency are same!
- And return the sum of their frequency i.e. **`4 + 2 + 1 => 7`**  
    ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/77c95d59-4e2a-42d4-bc08-fe7152285177_1717462121.8960083.png)

**Let's understand with one more example**

```javascript
Input: s = "aabbbbbcccdd"
Output: 11
```

Now let's try to solve this problem, using the given example!

- First, we going to create it's frequency map!
- `c` is **3**
- `d` is **2**
- `a` is **2**
- `b` is **5**
- And return the, maximum possible length of their frequency i.e. **`2 + 2 + 5 => 9`**
- But this is wrong, it can't be possible  
    ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/4f083123-8ca8-4f89-92ff-cc2291f87f00_1717462460.355122.png)

Why so, it's not possible! Because it doesn't mean if we have to take `c` character, we have to take it's all occurence. We can take only few as well.  
Even, characters we have to take at all cost. But, let's say we first take `b` all occuerence, but about the `c` has 3 occuerence, but we have already consider one odd previously i.e. `b`, but let's do one thing! Let's reduce down the `c` frequency by 1 to **2**. Now `c` is even, and we can have `c` too,. Let's look at it's diagram  
![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/904b5720-8d81-49e3-99ea-1b61d15f80aa_1717462818.4382663.png)

The biggest possible palindrome, we can have is of length **11**

So, now let's code it UP!

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestPalindrome(string s) {
        // Map to store frequency of occurrence of each character
        unordered_map<char, int> frequencyMap;
        // Count frequencies
        for (char c : s) {
            frequencyMap[c]++;
        }

        int res = 0;
        bool hasOddFrequency = false;
        for (auto& entry : frequencyMap) {
            int freq = entry.second;
            // Check if the frequency is even
            if (freq % 2 == 0) {
                res += freq;
            } else {
                // If the frequency is odd, one occurrence of the
                // character will remain without a match
                res += freq - 1;
                hasOddFrequency = true;
            }
        }
        // If hasOddFrequency is true, we have at least one unmatched
        // character to make the center of an odd length palindrome.
        if (hasOddFrequency) return res + 1;

        return res;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of the given string `s`.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    The algorithm goes through the characters of `s` twice: once to count their frequencies and once to construct the palindrome. Since hash table operations like inserting and updating take constant time (O(1)), the time complexity of the algorithm is O(2⋅n), which simplifies to O(n).
    
- Space complexity: O(1)
    
    The algorithm uses a hash table to store the frequency of characters. Given that there can be at most 52 unique characters in `s`, the space complexity is O(52), which can be simplified to O(1) space.
