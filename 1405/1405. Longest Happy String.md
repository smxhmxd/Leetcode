### Description

A string `s` is called **happy** if it satisfies the following conditions:

- `s` only contains the letters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.
- `s` does not contain any of `"aaa"`, `"bbb"`, or `"ccc"` as a substring.
- `s` contains **at most** `a` occurrences of the letter `'a'`.
- `s` contains **at most** `b` occurrences of the letter `'b'`.
- `s` contains **at most** `c` occurrences of the letter `'c'`.

Given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, return _the **longest possible happy** string_. If there are multiple longest happy strings, return _any of them_. If there is no such string, return _the empty string_ `""`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

```cpp
Input: a = 1, b = 1, c = 7
Output: "ccaccbcc"
Explanation: "ccbccacc" would also be a correct answer.
```

**Example 2:**

```cpp
Input: a = 7, b = 1, c = 0
Output: "aabaa"
Explanation: It is the only correct answer in this case.
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= a, b, c <= 100`
- `a + b + c > 0`

**My Implementation**

```cpp
//Approach (simple thought process - heap)
//T.C : O(a+b+c)
//S.C : O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    typedef pair<int, char> P;
    string longestDiverseString(int a, int b, int c) {
        priority_queue<P, vector<P>> pq; //max-heap

        if(a > 0) {
            pq.push({a, 'a'});
        }
        if(b > 0) {
            pq.push({b, 'b'});
        }
        if(c > 0) {
            pq.push({c, 'c'});
        }

        string result = "";

        while(!pq.empty()) {
            int currCount = pq.top().first;
            int currChar = pq.top().second;
            pq.pop();

            if(result.length() >= 2 && result[result.length()-1] == currChar && result[result.length()-2] == currChar) {
                //we can't use currChar. Check for next largest freqency char
                if(pq.empty()) {
                    break;
                }

                int nextCount = pq.top().first;
                int nextChar = pq.top().second;
                pq.pop();

                result.push_back(nextChar);
                nextCount--;
                if(nextCount > 0) {
                    pq.push({nextCount, nextChar});
                }
            } else {
                currCount--;
                result.push_back(currChar);
            }

            if(currCount > 0) {
                pq.push({currCount, currChar});
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

## Solution

### Approach 1: Priority Queue

#### Intuition

We are given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the number of characters `a`, `b`, and `c` we can use. The goal is to create the longest string possible with these characters while making sure that no three consecutive characters are the same.

To make the string as long as possible, we should try to use the character that appears most often without breaking the rule about three consecutive characters. If using the most frequent character would cause three in a row, we use the next most frequent character instead.

We can use a max-heap to solve this problem efficiently. The heap lets us pick the character with the highest remaining count, and switch to the next character if needed to avoid triples.

First, we put the counts of `a`, `b`, and `c` into a max-heap. If adding the most frequent character would create three in a row, we pick the second most frequent one. After adding a character, we reduce its count. If it still has characters left, we put it back into the heap.

By always selecting the character with the highest count, except when it would break the rule, we ensure the string is as long as possible.

#### Algorithm

1. Create a max-heap `pq` to store the counts of `a`, `b`, and `c` in descending order of their counts and a string `ans` to store the string answer.
2. Push `(a, 'a')`, `(b, 'b')`, and `(c, 'c')` into the heap if their counts are greater than 0.
3. Iterate Until `pq` is Empty:
    - Pop the most frequent character from the heap.
    - If adding this character would result in three consecutive identical characters in the answer string, do the following:
        - Check the next most frequent character by popping it from the heap.
        - Add this second character to the answer. If its `count` is still positive after use, push it back into the heap.
        - Push the previously popped character (the most frequent) back into the heap without adding it to the answer yet.
    - Otherwise, if the character can be added without violating the three-consecutive rule, append it to `ans` and decrement its `count`.
    - If a character’s count is still greater than 0 after being appended, push it back into the heap.
4. Once the heap is empty and no more characters can be added, return the constructed string `ans` as the result.

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string longestDiverseString(int a, int b, int c) {
        priority_queue<pair<int, char>> pq;
        // Add the counts of a, b and c in priority queue.
        if (a > 0) {
            pq.push({a, 'a'});
        }

        if (b > 0) {
            pq.push({b, 'b'});
        }

        if (c > 0) {
            pq.push({c, 'c'});
        }

        string ans = "";
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            pair<int, char> p = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            int count = p.first;
            char character = p.second;
            // If three consecutive characters exist, pick the second most
            // frequent character.
            if (ans.length() >= 2 and ans[ans.length() - 1] == p.second and
                ans[ans.length() - 2] == p.second) {
                if (pq.empty()) break;

                pair<int, char> temp = pq.top();
                pq.pop();
                ans += temp.second;
                if (temp.first - 1 > 0) {
                    pq.push({temp.first - 1, temp.second});
                }
            } else {
                count--;
                ans = ans + character;
            }

            // If count is greater than zero, add it to priority queue.
            if (count > 0) {
                pq.push({count, character});
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(a+b+c)
    
    Each operation on the priority queue (insertion or removal) takes O(logk) time, where `k` is the number of distinct characters. In this case, `k` is equal to 3, so each heap operation takes O(log3), which simplifies to O(1) time.
    
    In each iteration, one character is either added to the result string or skipped, and there are `a+b+c` characters in total. Therefore, the total number of iterations is proportional to `a+b+c`.
    
    Thus, the overall time complexity is O(a+b+c).
    
- Space complexity: O(1)
    
    The space complexity is O(1), as the heap contains at most three elements and the result string uses O(a+b+c) space (not counted in the solution space).

### Approach 2: Greedy Approach

#### Intuition

Since we need to track the counts of only three characters, we can use three counters instead of a priority queue.

As we build the string, we check which counter has the highest count. We also track how many times we add each letter in a row. We keep separate counters (`curra`, `currb`, and `currc`) for how many times we add 'a', 'b', or 'c' consecutively.

If one of these counters reaches 2, we stop adding that letter. Instead, we add a letter with a counter of 0. By repeating this process, we can create the longest possible string.

#### Algorithm

1. Set `curra`, `currb`, and `currc` to 0. These integers will track the current count of consecutive 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's added to the result string.
2. Calculate `totalIterations` as the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. Initialize an empty string `ans` to store the final result.
4. Iterate Through Total Iterations:
    - For each iteration from 0 to `totalIterations - 1`, determine which character to add to the result string:
        - Condition for 'a':
            - If 'a' has the highest count compared to 'b' and 'c' and its consecutive count `curra` is less than 2, or if 'a' has remaining characters and either `currb` or `currc` equals 2, then add 'a' to the string.
            - Decrement the count of 'a' and increment `curra`. Reset `currb` and `currc` to 0.
        - Condition for 'b':
            - If 'b' has the highest count compared to 'a' and 'c' and its consecutive count `currb` is less than 2, or if 'b' has remaining characters and either `curra` or `currc` equals 2, then add 'b' to the string.
            - Decrement the count of 'b' and increment `currb`. Reset `curra` and `currc` to 0.
        - Condition for 'c':
            - If 'c' has the highest count compared to 'a' and 'b' and its consecutive count `currc` is less than 2, or if 'c' has remaining characters and either `curra` or `currb` equals 2, then add 'c' to the string.
            - Decrement the count of 'c' and increment `currc`. Reset `curra` and `currb` to 0.
5. Return the `ans` string.

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string longestDiverseString(int a, int b, int c) {
        int curra = 0, currb = 0, currc = 0;
        // Maximum total iterations possible is given by the sum of a, b and c.
        int totalIterations = a + b + c;
        string ans = "";

        for (int i = 0; i < totalIterations; i++) {
            if ((a >= b and a >= c and curra != 2) or
                (a > 0 and (currb == 2 or currc == 2))) {
                // If 'a' is maximum and it's streak is less than 2, or if
                // streak of 'b' or 'c' is 2, then 'a' will be the next
                // character.
                ans += 'a';
                a--;
                curra++;
                currb = 0;
                currc = 0;
            } else if ((b >= a and b >= c and currb != 2) or
                       (b > 0 and (currc == 2 or curra == 2))) {
                // If 'b' is maximum and it's streak is less than 2, or if
                // streak of 'a' or 'c' is 2, then 'b' will be the next
                // character.
                ans += 'b';
                b--;
                currb++;
                curra = 0;
                currc = 0;
            } else if ((c >= a and c >= b and currc != 2) or
                       (c > 0 and (curra == 2 or currb == 2))) {
                // If 'c' is maximum and it's streak is less than 2, or if
                // streak of 'a' or 'b' is 2, then 'c' will be the next
                // character.
                ans += 'c';
                c--;
                currc++;
                curra = 0;
                currb = 0;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(a+b+c)
    
    We iterate through the string for a total of `a+b+c` iterations, which is the maximum possible length of the string. Each iteration involves a constant amount of work (checking conditions and appending a character to the result).
    
- Space complexity: O(1)
    
    The space used for the counters `curra`, `currb`, and `currc` is constant and does not depend on the input size, so it does not affect the overall space complexity.
