### Description

You are given the `root` of a binary tree where each node has a value in the range `[0, 25]` representing the letters `'a'` to `'z'`.

Return _the **lexicographically smallest** string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root_.

As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is **lexicographically smaller**.

- For example, `"ab"` is lexicographically smaller than `"aba"`.

A leaf of a node is a node that has no children.

### Overview

We are given the root of a binary tree, where each node has a value in the range `[0, 25]` representing the letters `'a'` to `'z'`. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf node and ends at the root of the binary tree.

**Key Observations:**

1. The string should start from a leaf node and end at the root node.
2. The string should be the smallest lexicographically, where a shorter prefix is considered smaller than a longer prefix of equal lexicographical size.
3. The input values are numbers and represent characters from `'a'` to `'z'`, and the output needs to be returned as a string of characters.

### Approach 1: Depth First Search (DFS)

#### Intuition

A common approach to solving this problem is to use a depth-first search (DFS), exploring the tree from the leaf nodes to the root and keeping track of the current string. The idea is to recursively explore all possible paths while maintaining the lexicographically smallest string encountered along the way.

During traversal, we ensure that we visit all nodes to avoid missing any potential lexicographically smallest string. To achieve this, we maintain track of the current values traversed to construct the current string.

As we explore different paths, we check if the current string is lexicographically smaller than the previously encountered smallest string. If the current string is lexicographically smaller, we update it; otherwise, we continue our exploration.

> **Note:** You may wonder whether a greedy algorithm that assumes that each local optimal step will eventually lead to a globally optimal solution could solve this problem. Consider the test case [4,0,1,1]. In this scenario, a greedy approach would fail to produce the correct result. Similarly, in the case of [25,1,null,0,0,1,null,null,null,0], the expected answer is "ababz", but the greedy solution would result in "abz".

#### Algorithm

- Initialize an empty string `smallestString` to store the lexicographically smallest string.
    
- Call the helper function `dfs(root, "")`.
    
    - The `dfs` function takes the current node `root` and the current string `currentString` as parameters.
- Inside the `dfs` function:
    
    - If the current node `root` is NULL, return (base case).
    - Construct the `currentString` by appending the character corresponding to the current node's value to the beginning of the `currentString`.
    - If the current node `root` is a leaf node:
        - If `smallestString` is empty or if the `currentString` is lexicographically smaller than `smallestString`:  
            - Update `smallestString` to be the `currentString`.
    - Recursively call `dfs` on the left child of the current node (if it exists).
    - Recursively call `dfs` on the right child of the current node (if it exists).
- After the `dfs` function call, return the `smallestString`.
    

> **Note:** Characters are represented as integers using ASCII values. For lowercase letters, the ASCII values start from 97 for `'a'`, 98 for `'b'`, and so on.
> 
> - Now, consider the expression `char(root->val + 'a')`. Here, `root->val` represents some integer value. Adding it to 'a' (which is 97) essentially shifts it to the corresponding position in the alphabet. For example, if `root->val` is 0, then `root->val + 'a'` becomes 97 ('a' in ASCII), resulting in the character 'a'. Similarly, if `root->val` is 1, then `root->val + 'a'` becomes 98 ('b' in ASCII), resulting in the character 'b', and so on. So, the expression `char(root->val + 'a')` converts the integer value `root->val` into its corresponding lowercase alphabetical character.

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string smallestString;
    
    string smallestFromLeaf(TreeNode* root) {
        dfs(root, "");
        return smallestString;
    }

    // Helper function to find the lexicographically smallest string
    void dfs(TreeNode* root, string currentString) {

        // If the current node is NULL, return
        if (!root) {
            return;
        }

        // Construct the current string by appending 
        // the character corresponding to the node's value
        currentString = char(root->val + 'a') + currentString; 

        // If the current node is a leaf node
        if (!root->left && !root->right) { 
            
            // If the current string is smaller than the result 
            // or if the result is empty
            if (smallestString == "" || smallestString > currentString) { 
                smallestString = currentString;
            }
        }

        // Recursively traverse the left subtree
        if (root->left) {
            dfs(root->left, currentString);
        }

        // Recursively traverse the right subtree
        if (root->right) {
            dfs(root->right, currentString);
        }
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of nodes in the binary tree.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    During the depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the tree, we traverse each of the n nodes exactly once. When we handle a node, the string concatenation and comparison operations take constant time, so the whole traversal takes O(n) time.
    
    In Java and Python, since strings are immutable, concatenating a character to the beginning of a string requires creating a new string, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).
    
    Thus, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n).
    
- Space complexity: O(n)
    
    This space is utilized for the recursive function calls on the call stack during the DFS traversal, which is equal to the height of the tree. In the worst-case scenario, when the tree is completely unbalanced (skewed), the height of the tree can be equal to the number of nodes, resulting in O(n) space complexity.
    
    Additionally, the space used for the `currentString` variable during the traversal is at most O(n) when the tree is unbalanced.
    
    Thus, the overall space complexity of the algorithm is O(n).

### Approach 2: Breadth First Search (BFS) Approach

#### Intuition

Apart from DFS, we can also utilize the BFS approach to achieve the same outcome. In BFS, we implement a level-order traversal method, where we traverse the nodes level by level. Initially, we initialize an empty string to store the smallest path found so far and a queue to facilitate BFS traversal.

Given that the tree contains integer values that need to be returned as characters, we append nodes to the queue during traversal. Each node is accompanied by its value, converted to characters.

During each iteration, if the current node has a left child, we append it to the queue. Additionally, we concatenate the current string with the character representation of its value and include it in the queue. Likewise, if the current node has a right child, we follow the same procedure.

Within each iteration, we pop the node from the front of the queue along with its corresponding string. If the node is a leaf node (i.e., it lacks both left and right children), we compare its corresponding string with the current smallest string found. If it's lexicographically smaller, we update the smallest string accordingly.

Once the queue becomes empty, which signifies the completion of traversal for all paths from the root to the leaf nodes, the smallest string found represents the lexicographically smallest path from the root to a leaf node in the binary tree.

> **Note:** One advantage of DFS over BFS is its ability to avoid the need to create new string versions for each state. Instead, it allows for continuous appending and removal from a single string as child nodes are traversed. This eliminates the need to maintain multiple string states within the queue, simplifying the process compared to the BFS approach.

#### Algorithm

- Initialize an empty string, `smallestString`, to store the lexicographically smallest string.
- Initialize an empty queue, `nodeQueue`, for storing node-value pairs.
- Add the root node and its value, converted to a character, to the back of the `nodeQueue`.
- While the `nodeQueue` is not empty:
    - Pop the front node and its corresponding string from the `nodeQueue`.
    - If the current node is a leaf node and if `smallestString` is empty or the current string `currentString` is lexicographically smaller than `smallestString`, update `smallestString` to be the current string `currentString`.
    - If the current node has a left child:
        - Add the left child and the string obtained by prepending the left child's value to `currentString` to the back of the `nodeQueue`.
    - If the current node has a right child:
        - Add the right child and the string obtained by prepending the right child's value to `currentString` to the back of the `nodeQueue`.
- Return the string `smallestString`.

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string smallestFromLeaf(TreeNode* root) {
        string smallestString = "";
        queue<pair<TreeNode*, string>> nodeQueue;

        // Add root node to queue along with its value converted to a character
        nodeQueue.push({root, string(1, root->val + 'a')});

        // Perform BFS traversal until queue is empty
        while (!nodeQueue.empty()) {

            // Pop the leftmost node and its corresponding string from queue
            auto[node, currentString] = nodeQueue.front();
            nodeQueue.pop();

            // If current node is a leaf node
            if (!node->left && !node->right) {

                // Update smallest_string if it's empty or current string is smaller
                if (smallestString.empty()) {
                    smallestString = currentString;
                } else {
                    smallestString = min(smallestString, currentString);
                }
            }

            // If current node has a left child, append it to queue
            if (node->left) {
                nodeQueue.push({node->left, char(node->left->val + 'a') + currentString});
            }

            // If current node has a right child, append it to queue
            if (node->right) {
                nodeQueue.push({node->right, char(node->right->val + 'a') + currentString});
            }
        }

        return smallestString;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of nodes in the binary tree.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    Each node of the binary tree is visited once. Therefore, the time complexity of the BFS traversal is O(n).
    
    At each step of the BFS traversal, we append nodes to the queue. Appending to a queue takes O(1) time on average. At each leaf node, we compare the current string with the smallest string. Since the length of the string is bounded by the height of the tree and since the height is n when unbalanced, the time complexity for comparing strings at each leaf node is O(n).
    
    Overall, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(n).
    
- Space complexity: O(n)
    
    We use a queue to store nodes and their corresponding strings during BFS traversal. Therefore, in the worst-case scenario for space complexity, the queue may contain all the nodes of the binary tree, resulting in a space complexity of O(n).
