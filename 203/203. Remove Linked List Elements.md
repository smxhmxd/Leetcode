### Description

Given theÂ `head`Â of a linked list and an integerÂ `val`, remove all the nodes of the linked list that hasÂ `Node.val == val`, and returnÂ _the new head_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/06/removelinked-list.jpg)

**Input:** head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
**Output:** [1,2,3,4,5]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = [], val = 1
**Output:** []

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
**Output:** []

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the rangeÂ `[0, 10^4]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 50`
- `0 <= val <= 50`

**My Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {

public:

Â  Â  ListNode* removeElements(ListNode* head, int val) {

Â  Â  Â  Â  ListNode *temp = new ListNode(0);

Â  Â  Â  Â  temp->next = head;

Â  Â  Â  Â  ListNode *curr = temp;

Â  Â  Â  Â  while(curr->next != NULL ){

Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  if(curr->next->val == val) curr->next = curr->next->next;

Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  else curr = curr->next;

Â  Â  Â  Â  }

Â  Â  Â  Â  return temp->next;

Â  Â  }

};
```

[[237. Delete Node in a Linked List]]

In a linked list, given the head of the linked list and an integer value, we have to delete the node with that integer value from the linked list.

# Approach âœ…

To solve this problem, we will iterate through the linked list and check the value of each node. If the value of a node matches the specified value, we will remove that node from the linked list.

# Explanation

1. **Step 1 - Creating a Dummy Node**:ğŸ‘ˆ
    
    - A new ListNode namedÂ _'temp'_Â is created with a value of 0. This node serves as a dummy head node to simplify edge cases, especially when the head node itself needs to be removed.
    - _'curr'_Â is a reference that initially points to the same dummy node.
    - The next ofÂ _'temp'_Â is set to head, effectively inserting the dummy node before the actual head of the list.  
        `ListNode temp = new ListNode(0);` 
        ` curr = temp; temp->next = head;`
1. **Step 2 - Iterating through the List:**Â ğŸ‘ˆ
    
    - The loop continues as long as the next node afterÂ _'curr'_Â is not null.
    - Inside the loop, it checks if the val of the next node (curr->next->val) is equal to the target value val.
    - If it is,Â _'curr->next'_Â is updated toÂ _'curr->next->next'_, effectively removing the current next node from the list.
    - If it is not, curr is moved to the next node in the list.

```python
while(curr->next != null )
{
    if(curr->next->val == val) 
	    curr->next = curr->next->next;
    else 
	    curr = curr->next;
}
```

3. **Step 3 - Returning the Modified List:**Â ğŸ‘ˆ
    
    - Finally, the method returnsÂ _'temp->next'_. SinceÂ _'temp'_Â is the dummy head node, temp->next is the actual head of the modified list.
    - If the original head was removed, this effectively returns the new head of the list. If the original head was not removed, it still points to the original head.
    
```python
return temp->next;
```
    

# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
- Space complexity: O(1)
    

# Code ğŸ‘ˆ

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeElements(ListNode* head, int val) {
        ListNode *temp = new ListNode(0);
        temp->next = head;
        ListNode *curr = temp;
        while(curr->next != NULL ){
            if(curr->next->val == val) curr->next = curr->next->next;
            else curr = curr->next;
        }
        return temp->next;
    }
};
```

# Dry Run

1. Entering the While Loop:
    
    - The condition of the while loop is curr->next != null. Since curr is initially pointing to the dummy node (0), curr->next is 1, which is not null. So we enter the loop.
2. First Iteration:
    
    - curr->next->val is 1, which is not equal to 6.
    - So, curr is moved to the next node. Now, curr points to 1.
3. Second Iteration:
    
    - curr->next->val is 2, which is not equal to 6.
    - Move curr to the next node. Now, curr points to 2.
4. Third Iteration:
    
    - curr->next->val is 6, which matches val.
    - We remove this node by setting curr->next to curr->next->next. The list is now 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.
    - curr stays at the same node (2).
5. Fourth Iteration:
    
    - curr->next->val is 3, which is not equal to 6.
    - Move curr to the next node. Now, curr points to 3.
6. Fifth Iteration:
    
    - curr->next->val is 4, which is not equal to 6.
    - Move curr to the next node. Now, curr points to 4.
7. Sixth Iteration:
    
    - curr->next->val is 5, which is not equal to 6.
    - Move curr to the next node. Now, curr points to 5.
8. Seventh Iteration:
    
    - curr->next->val is 6, which matches val.
    - We remove this node by setting curr->next to curr->next->next. Since curr->next->next is null, the last node (6) is removed. The list is now 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.
    - curr stays at the same node (5).
9. Eighth Iteration:
    
    - curr->next is now null, so we exit the loop.

**Result:**

- The dummy node (0) points to the head of the modified list, which is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.
- The method returns temp->next, which is the head of the modified list.
