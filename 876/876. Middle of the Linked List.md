### Description

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return _the middle node of the linked list_.

If there are two middle nodes, return **the second middle** node.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist1.jpg)

**Input:** head = \[1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** \[3,4,5]
**Explanation:** The middle node of the list is node 3.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist2.jpg)

**Input:** head = \[1,2,3,4,5,6]
**Output:** \[4,5,6]
**Explanation:** Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`

**My Implementation**

```cpp
//T.C : O(n)
//S.C : O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* first  = head;
        ListNode* second = head;
        
        while(first && second && second->next) {
            first = first->next;
            second = second->next->next;
        }
        
        return first;
    }
};
```

# Intuition

1. Just imagine you are climbing stairs with your friend
2. you both start together from bottom of stairs
3. you are taking one step at a time and your friend is taking two step at time
4. when he reach to top of stairs where will you be

# Approach

1. Initialization: Start with two pointers, fast and slow, both pointing to the head of the list.
    
2. Traversal: Move the fast pointer two steps at a time and the slow pointer one step at a time. This ensures that when the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle node.
    
3. Find the Middle Node: After traversal, the slow pointer will be at the middle node of the list.
    
4. Edge Case Handling: Check if the list is empty or contains only one node. In such cases, the middle node is the head itself.
    
5. Return: Return the node pointed to by the slow pointer as the middle node.
    

Example for odd nodes

if you want to check for even nodes imagin 5th node is NULL  
and dry run where will be slow node if fast pointer reach to 5th node

# Complexity

- Time complexity : O(n)

- Space complexity : O(1)

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
       if(head == NULL || head->next == NULL)return head;
        ListNode* fast=head->next;
        ListNode* slow=head;

        while(fast != NULL){
            fast = fast->next;
            if(fast != NULL)fast = fast->next;

            slow = slow->next;
        }

        return slow;
    }
};
```
