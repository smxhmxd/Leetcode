### Description

Given a sorted integer array `nums` and an integer `n`, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in the range `[1, n]` inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array.

Return _the minimum number of patches required_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,3], n = 6
**Output:** 1
Explanation:
Combinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.
Now if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].
Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].
So we only need 1 patch.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,5,10], n = 20
**Output:** 2
Explanation: The two patches can be [2, 4].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,2], n = 5
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `nums` is sorted in **ascending order**.
- `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

**My Implementation**

```cpp
//Approach (Greedy observation)
//T.C : O(max(l, log(n)), l = length of nums
//S.C : O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    int minPatches(vector<int>& nums, int n) {
        long maxReach = 0;
        int patch     = 0;
        int i         = 0;

        while(maxReach < n) {
            if(i < nums.size() && nums[i] <= maxReach+1) {
               maxReach += nums[i];
               i++;
            } else {
               maxReach += (maxReach + 1);
               patch++;
            }
        }
        return patch;
    }
};
```

# Intuition

- The code works like providing change with limited coin denominations. Suppose you need to cover every amount up to 𝑛 cents. If you can't make exact change for a particular amount miss, it indicates you lack a coin of value less than or equal to miss. To fill this gap, you add a coin of that exact missing amount. This addition allows you to now cover new amounts up to 2 * miss. Repeat this process until you can provide change for every amount up to 𝑛. This method ensures you add the minimum number of new coins needed to cover any shortages.

# Approach

If its hard to understand the approach, I have clear explanation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2IomuIFbPg).

- **Initialize Variables:** Start with miss set to 1, added to 0, and index i at 0 to track the smallest sum that cannot be formed and the number of patches added.
    
- **Iterate with Condition:** Continue the loop as long as miss (the target sum we need to achieve) is less than or equal to n.
    
- **Use Existing Numbers:** Check if the current number in the list (nums[i]) can be used to form miss. If yes, add it to miss to extend the range of formable sums and increment the index i.
    
- **Add Necessary Numbers:** If nums[i] is greater than miss or all numbers are already used, add miss itself to cover the smallest unformable sum, and double the value of miss.
    
- **Increment Added Count:** Whenever a number is added to cover a gap, increase the added counter.
    
- **Return Total Patches:** Once miss exceeds n, return the total count of added numbers as the result, representing the minimum patches needed to form every number up to n.
    

**Example:**

**Input: [1, 5, 10]**

|Step|Current nums|Miss|Action|Reason|New Coverage|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|[1, 5, 10]|1|Use 1|1 is available and matches miss|Sums up to 1|
|2|[1, 5, 10]|2|Add 2|5 is too large to form sum 2|Sums up to 3|
|3|[1, 5, 10]|4|Add 4|5 is too large to form sum 4|Sums up to 7|
|4|[1, 5, 10]|8|Use 5|Can use 5 with existing numbers to form 8|Sums up to 12|
|5|[1, 5, 10]|13|Use 10|Can use 10 with existing numbers to form 13|Sums up to 22|

# Complexity

- Time complexity:  
    **O(N)**
    
- Space complexity:  
    **O(1)**
# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPatches(vector<int>& nums, int n) {
        long long miss = 1;
        int result = 0;
        size_t i = 0;

        while (miss <= n) {
            if (i < nums.size() && nums[i] <= miss) {
                miss += nums[i];
                i++;
            } else {
                miss += miss;
                result++;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```
