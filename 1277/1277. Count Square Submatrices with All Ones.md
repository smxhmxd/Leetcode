### Approach 1: Top-Down Dynamic Programming

#### Intuition

We need to find the number of square submatrices containing only ones in a binary matrix. A square submatrix has equal rows and columns, such as `1x1`, `2x2`, `3x3`, and so on.

1. 1x1 submatrices: Each cell with a `1` contributes directly to the count.
2. Larger submatrices: For submatrices larger than `1x1`, the size of the largest square submatrix with its bottom right corner at `(i, j)` determines the count of possible square submatrices.

![slide1](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-square-submatrices-with-all-ones/Figures/1277re/Slide1re.png)

For a `2x2` square ending at `(i, j)`, the following conditions must be met:

- The cell at `(i, j)` must be `1`.
- The cells above `(i-1, j)`, to the left `(i, j-1)`, and diagonally `(i-1, j-1)` must also be `1`.

![slide2](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-square-submatrices-with-all-ones/Figures/1277re/Slide2re.png)

For a `3x3` square, the requirements are similar:

- The cell at `(i, j)` must be `1`.
- The `2x2` square formed by the neighbors `(i-1, j-1)`, `(i-1, j)`, and `(i, j-1)` must be valid.

![slide3](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-square-submatrices-with-all-ones/Figures/1277re/Slide3re.png)

Thus, constructing larger submatrices relies on the existence of smaller valid ones.

We can approach this problem using recursion, breaking it down into smaller subproblems. At each cell `(i, j)`, the size of the largest square submatrix depends on the sizes of the submatrices at its neighboring cells: `(i-1, j)`, `(i, j-1)`, and `(i-1, j-1)`. This recursive structure enables us to tackle the problem incrementally.

To optimize, we can convert the recursive approach into a dynamic programming (DP) solution. The DP table will store results of subproblems, preventing redundant calculations and improving time complexity.

#### Algorithm

`solve(i, j, grid, dp)` function:

1. If the current cell `grid[i][j]` is outside the bounds of the grid or is 0, return 0. This means no square submatrices can be formed from this cell.
2. If a cell's result is already computed (i.e., `dp[i][j]` != -1), return the memoized value to avoid redundant calculations.
3. For each cell `(i, j)`, recursively calculate the size of the square submatrices:
    - right: Check the cell to the right `(i, j+1)`.
    - diagonal: Check the cell to the diagonal below `(i+1, j+1)`.
    - below: Check the cell below `(i+1, j)`.
4. For a given cell `(i, j)`, store the result as `1 + min(right, diagonal, below)` in the `dp` table. This accounts for the size of the largest square submatrix that can end at this cell, including the current cell itself.

Main function:

1. Initialize a DP table:
    - Create a `dp` table (2D vector) of the same size as the input grid, and initialize it with -1 to indicate unvisited cells.
2. Use a nested loop to iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell `(i, j)`, call the recursive function `solve(i, j)` to compute the size of the largest square submatrices ending at that cell and add it to the total count.
3. Finally, return the total number of square submatrices with all 1s.

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solve(int i, int j, vector<vector<int>>& grid,
              vector<vector<int>>& dp) {
        // If the cell lies outside the grid, return 0.
        if (i >= grid.size() || j >= grid[0].size()) return 0;
        if (grid[i][j] == 0) return 0;

        // If we have already visited this cell, return the memoized value.
        if (dp[i][j] != -1) return dp[i][j];

        // Find the answer for the cell to the right of the current cell.
        int right = solve(i, j + 1, grid, dp);
        // Find the answer for the cell to the diagonal of the current cell.
        int diagonal = solve(i + 1, j + 1, grid, dp);
        // Find the answer for the cell below the current cell.
        int below = solve(i + 1, j, grid, dp);

        return dp[i][j] = 1 + min(right, min(diagonal, below));
    }

    int countSquares(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int ans = 0;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(grid.size(), vector<int>(grid[0].size(), -1));
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                ans += solve(i, j, grid, dp);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let row and col be the number of rows and columns in the matrix respectively.

- Time complexity: O(row⋅col)
    
    The `solve(i, j)` function is called for each cell in the grid. However, due to memoization, the value for each cell is computed only once, and the result is stored in the `dp` table. This prevents recomputation for the same cell.
    
    Hence, there are `row * col` calls to the function, where `row` is the number of rows, and `col` is the number of columns.
    
    For each cell `(i, j)`, the function makes constant time calculations for its neighbors: `right`, `diagonal`, and `below`. Each of these operations takes constant time `O(1)`.
    
    Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(row * col)`.
    
- Space complexity: O(row⋅col)
    
    The `dp` table is a 2D array of size `row * col` used to store the memoized results. This requires `O(row * col)` space.
    
    The recursion depth is bounded by the number of rows `row` or columns `col` in the worst case, depending on how far the recursion can go in the grid. This requires `O(max(row, col))` space for the call stack.
    
    Thus, the overall space complexity is `O(row * col)`.

### Approach 2: Bottom-up Approach

#### Intuition

Tabulation is a dynamic programming technique that involves systematically iterating through all possible combinations of changing parameters. Since tabulation operates iteratively, rather than recursively, it does not require overhead for the recursive stack space, making it more efficient than memoization. We have two variables that change as we progress through the matrix: the current row index and the current column index. To thoroughly explore the combinations, we use two nested loops to iterate through these variables.

First, we establish the base case: if the element at `matrix[i][j]` is `0`, then `dp[i][j] = 0`, indicating no square submatrix can end at that position.

Our goal is to count the total number of square submatrices filled with all 1s. To achieve this, we traverse the matrix using the outer loop for rows and the inner loop for columns. For each cell containing `1`, we calculate the size of the largest square submatrix that can end at that cell by taking the minimum of the square submatrices that can end to the left, above, and diagonally above-left. We update our tabulation matrix with the formula:

dp[i][j]=min(dp[i−1][j],dp[i][j−1],dp[i−1][j−1])+1

After completing the traversal, the total count of square submatrices filled with all 1s will be accumulated in the final result.

#### Algorithm

1. Create a 2D DP table `dp` of size `(row+1) x (col+1)` to store the size of the largest square submatrices ending at each cell `(i, j)`.
2. This extra row and column (initialized to 0) help handle boundary conditions and simplify the logic for edge cases.
3. Initialize a variable `ans` to keep track of the total number of square submatrices with all 1s.
4. Traverse the input matrix using a nested loop:
    - Outer loop iterates over the rows (`i` from 0 to `row-1`).
        - Inner loop iterates over the columns (`j` from 0 to `col-1`):
            - For each cell `matrix[i][j]`, if the value is 1, calculate the size of the square submatrix ending at that cell.
            - Use the following relation to fill the `dp` matrix: `dp[i+1][j+1] = min(dp[i][j+1],dp[i+1][j],dp[i][j])+1`
            - Add this value to the total count `ans`, which keeps track of all squares found so far.
5. Return the value of `ans`, which represents the total number of square submatrices filled with 1s.

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countSquares(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int row = matrix.size(), col = matrix[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(row + 1, vector<int>(col + 1, 0));
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == 1) {
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1] =
                        min({dp[i][j + 1], dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j]}) + 1;
                    ans += dp[i + 1][j + 1];
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let row and col be the number of rows and columns in the matrix respectively.

- Time complexity: O(row⋅col)
    
    The solution iterates through every cell in the matrix using two nested loops. Since the matrix has dimensions `row x col`, the total number of cells is `row x col`.
    
    Inside the loop, we perform constant-time operations (computing the minimum of three values and updating the result).
    
    Thus, the overall time complexity is O(row⋅col).
    
- Space complexity: O(row⋅col).
    
    The space complexity is dominated by the 2D DP table `dp`, which is of size `(row+1) x (col+1)`. This extra row and column are used to handle boundary conditions.
    
    Therefore, the total space required is O(row⋅col).
