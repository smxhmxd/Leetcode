### Description

Given a string `s` consisting only of characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`. You are asked to apply the following algorithm on the string any number of times:

1. Pick a **non-empty** prefix from the string `s` where all the characters in the prefix are equal.
2. Pick a **non-empty** suffix from the string `s` where all the characters in this suffix are equal.
3. The prefix and the suffix should not intersect at any index.
4. The characters from the prefix and suffix must be the same.
5. Delete both the prefix and the suffix.

Return _the **minimum length** of_ `s` _after performing the above operation any number of times (possibly zero times)_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "ca"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** You can't remove any characters, so the string stays as is.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "cabaabac"
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** An optimal sequence of operations is:
- Take prefix = "c" and suffix = "c" and remove them, s = "abaaba".
- Take prefix = "a" and suffix = "a" and remove them, s = "baab".
- Take prefix = "b" and suffix = "b" and remove them, s = "aa".
- Take prefix = "a" and suffix = "a" and remove them, s = "".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "aabccabba"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** An optimal sequence of operations is:
- Take prefix = "aa" and suffix = "a" and remove them, s = "bccabb".
- Take prefix = "b" and suffix = "bb" and remove them, s = "cca".

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` only consists of characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.

**My Implementation**

```cpp
//Using simple 2 Pointers
//T.C : O(n)
//S.C : O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumLength(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        
        int i = 0, j = n-1;
        
        while(i < j && s[i] == s[j]) {
            char ch = s[i];
            
            while(i < j && s[i] == ch) {
                i++;
            }
            
            while(j >= i && s[j] == ch) {
                j--;
            }
        }
        
        return j-i+1;
    }
};
```

### Approach 1: Two Pointers
#### Algorithm

1. Initialize two variables, `begin` to `0` and `end` to `s.length() - 1`. `begin` points to the first index of `s` and `end` points to the last index.
2. While `begin` is less than `end` and the character at `s[begin]` equals the character at `s[end]`:
    - Initialize a character `c` to `s[begin]`.
    - While `begin` is less than or equal to `end` and `s[begin]` equals `c`, increment `begin` by `1` to delete a prefix character.
    - While `end` is greater than `begin` and `s[end]` equals `c`, decrement `end` by `1` to delete a suffix character.
3. After processing `s`, return `end - begin + 1`, the number of remaining characters.

#### Implementation

**Implementation 1: Iterative**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumLength(string s) {
        int begin = 0;
        int end = s.length() - 1;

// Delete similar ends until the ends differ or they meet in the middle
        while (begin < end && s[begin] == s[end]) {
            char c = s[begin];

// Delete consecutive occurrences of c from prefix
            while (begin <= end && s[begin] == c) {
                begin++;
            }

    // Delete consecutive occurrences of c from suffix
            while (end > begin && s[end] == c) {
                end--;
            }
        }

        // Return the number of remaining characters
        return end - begin + 1;
    }
};
```

**Implementation 2: Tail Recursion**

We can implement the above approach recursively as well as iteratively. We can delete similar ends, and then recursively delete similar ends on the remaining string.

We use a helper function, `deleteSimilarEnds`, so we can pass `begin` and `end` as parameters. The base case is when a prefix and suffix cannot be deleted because the ends differ or meet in the middle. In this case, we return the number of remaining characters.  
When there are similar ends, the function deletes them using a similar process as the above implementation and recursively calls itself.

In a recursive function, each recursive call creates a new stack frame, which can lead to a stack overflow if the function is called too many times. Tail recursion reduces this problem by reusing the current stack frame instead of creating a new one.  
It's an optimization technique used in functional programming to avoid the use of explicit loops and improve performance.

To use tail recursion, the last statement of a function must be a recursive call, and the function must have a base case that can be reached by the recursive call. The base case is used to stop the recursion and return a value.  
Since our approach has both conditions, we can use tail recursion in the below implementation.

> Note: The implementation shown here is provided for the purpose of building perspective on different ways to solve a problem. While the recursion-based solution is valid, the two-pointer implementation remains the most intuitive and optimized solution.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumLength(string s) {
        return deleteSimilarEnds(s, 0, s.length() - 1);
    }
private:
    // Deletes similar ends and returns remaining length 
    int deleteSimilarEnds(string &s, int begin, int end) 
    {
        // The ends differ or meet in the middle
        if (begin >= end || s[begin] != s[end]){
            return end - begin + 1;
        } else {
            char c = s[begin];

// Delete consecutive occurrences of c from prefix
            while (begin <= end && s[begin] == c)
                begin++;

// Delete consecutive occurrences of c from suffix
            while (end > begin && s[end] == c)
                end--;

            return deleteSimilarEnds(s, begin, end); 
        }  
    }
};
```

The time complexity of the recursive implementation is the same as the iterative implementation. The main space required for this recursive implementation is the call stack, which can grow as large as the number of recursive calls. There will be a recursive call for each pair of similar ends, and there can be as many as $\frac{n}{2}$ similar ends, so our implementation will have $\frac{n}{2}$ recursive calls. $\frac{n}{2}$ is a linear complexity, so we describe the space complexity as O(n).

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of `s`.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    We process `s` using the pointers `begin` and `end` until they meet in the middle. Although we use nested while loops, with each iteration, `begin` is incremented, and/or `end` is decremented, or the loop terminates because a prefix and suffix can no longer be deleted. We handle each character of `s` at most once, so the time complexity is O(n).
    
- Space complexity: O(1)
    
    The iterative implementation uses a few variables and no additional data structures that grow with input size, so the space complexity is constant, O(1).
