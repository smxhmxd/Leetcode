### Description

You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the `ith` person, and an **infinite number of boats** where each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return _the minimum number of boats to carry every given person_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** people = [1,2], limit = 3
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** 1 boat (1, 2)

**Example 2:**

**Input:** people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)

**Example 3:**

**Input:** people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= people.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 3 * 10^4`

**My Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numRescueBoats(vector<int>& people, int limit) {
        int n = people.size();
        
        
        //sort the array
        sort(begin(people), end(people));
        
        int i = 0, j = n-1;
        
        int boats = 0;
        
        while(i <= j) {
            if(people[j] + people[i] <= limit) {
                i++;
                j--;
            } else {
                j--;
            }
            boats += 1;
        }
        
        return boats;
    }
};
```

# Intuition

This problem aims to minimize the number of rescue boats required to save all people, pairing individuals if their combined weight permits within the given limit.

# Approach

1. **Sort the array:** The function first sorts the array of people in ascending order. This is crucial for the algorithm to work efficiently.

```java
Arrays.sort(people);
```

2. **Initialize pointers:** Two pointers, `i` and `j`, are initialized at the beginning and end of the sorted array, respectively.

```java
int i = 0, j = people.length - 1;
```

3. **Iterate through the array:** A while loop is used to iterate through the array from both ends (`i` from the beginning and `j` from the end) until they meet or cross each other.

```java
while (i <= j) {
    // Code goes here...
}
```

4. **Check if two people can fit in a boat:** Within the loop, it checks if the weight of the person at index `i` and the person at index `j` is less than or equal to the given limit.

```java
if ((people[j] + people[i]) <= limit) {
    i++; // If they can fit, move to the next person from the lighter side.
}
```

5. **Move pointer:** Regardless of whether two people can fit in a boat or not, the pointer `j` is decremented in each iteration to consider the next person from the heavier end of the array.

```java
j--;
```

6. **Count boats:** Increment the `boats` variable in each iteration to keep track of the number of boats required.

```java
boats++;
```

7. **Return the total number of boats:** Finally, the function returns the total number of boats required to rescue all the people.

```java
return boats;
```

# Complexity

- Time complexity:  
    O(n log n)
    
- Space complexity:  
    O(1)
    

# Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        int boats = 0;
        Arrays.sort(people);
        int i=0,j=people.length-1;
        while(i<=j){
            if((people[j]+people[i])<=limit){
                i++;
            }
            j--;
            boats++;
        }
        return boats;
    }
```
