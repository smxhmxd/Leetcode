### Description

A **bit flip** of a number `x` is choosing a bit in the binary representation of `x` and **flipping** it from either `0` to `1` or `1` to `0`.

- For example, for `x = 7`, the binary representation is `111` and we may choose any bit (including any leading zeros not shown) and flip it. We can flip the first bit from the right to get `110`, flip the second bit from the right to get `101`, flip the fifth bit from the right (a leading zero) to get `10111`, etc.

Given two integers `start` and `goal`, return _the **minimum** number of **bit flips** to convert_ `start` _to_ `goal`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** start = 10, goal = 7
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The binary representation of 10 and 7 are 1010 and 0111 respectively. We can convert 10 to 7 in 3 steps:
- Flip the first bit from the right: 1010 -> 1011.
- Flip the third bit from the right: 1011 -> 1111.
- Flip the fourth bit from the right: 1111 -> 0111.
It can be shown we cannot convert 10 to 7 in less than 3 steps. Hence, we return 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** start = 3, goal = 4
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The binary representation of 3 and 4 are 011 and 100 respectively. We can convert 3 to 4 in 3 steps:
- Flip the first bit from the right: 011 -> 010.
- Flip the second bit from the right: 010 -> 000.
- Flip the third bit from the right: 000 -> 100.
It can be shown we cannot convert 3 to 4 in less than 3 steps. Hence, we return 3.

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= start, goal <= 10^9`

**My Implementation**

```cpp
//Approach - 1(Using Loop & shift) 
//T.C : O(n) 
//S.C : O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
        int maxi = max(start, goal);
        int res = 0;
        while (maxi) {
            if ((start & 1) != (goal & 1))
                res++;

            start = start >> 1;
            goal = goal >> 1;
            maxi = maxi >> 1;
        }

        return res;
    }
};

// Approach - 2
// Time: O(1)
// Space: O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
        return __builtin_popcount(start^goal);
    }
};
```

# Intuition

The intuition is to iteratively checks each bit of the two numbers using a loop, which continues until the larger of `start` and `goal` becomes zero (indicating all bits have been checked). Within each iteration, it applies a bitwise AND with 1 to both numbers to extract their least significant bits, compares them, and increments a counter if they differ, indicating a flip is needed. Then, it right shifts both numbers to compare the next set of bits.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**: The solution begins by identifying the maximum of `start` and `goal`. This is used to determine the number of iterations needed, as the loop continues until `maxi` is reduced to zero. A variable `res` is initialized to count the number of bit flips required.
    
2. **Looping through Bits**: The solution uses a `while` loop that continues as long as `maxi` is not zero. This ensures that all the bits in the larger of the two numbers (`start` or `goal`) are examined.
    
3. **Bitwise Comparison and Shift**:
    
    - At each iteration, the least significant bit (LSB) of both `start` and `goal` is compared using the bitwise AND (`&`) operation with `1`. The expression `(start & 1)` extracts the LSB of `start`, and similarly `(goal & 1)` for `goal`. If these two LSBs are not equal, it signifies that a bit flip is needed at this position, and the `res` counter is incremented.
    - After the comparison, both `start` and `goal` are right-shifted (`>>`) by 1. This discards the LSB just examined and moves the next bit into the LSB position for comparison in the next iteration. Similarly, `maxi` is also right-shifted by 1 to eventually terminate the loop.
4. **Result**: Once all bits in the larger number have been examined, the loop ends, and the function returns `res`, the total number of bit flips required.
    

## Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(log(max(start, goal))).
    - The loop iterates over each bit of the maximum of `start` and `goal`. Since the number of bits in a binary representation of a number `n` is `O(log n)`, the time complexity is determined by the maximum of `start` and `goal`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1).
    - The solution uses a fixed amount of extra space, regardless of the input size. Variables `maxi`, `res`, `start`, and `goal` are the only additional storage used, and their size does not scale with the size of the input.

# Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
        int maxi = max(start, goal);
        int res = 0;
        while (maxi) {
            if ((start & 1) != (goal & 1))
                res++;

            start = start >> 1;
            goal = goal >> 1;
            maxi = maxi >> 1;
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```

## Approach - 2

To get minimum bit flips we find XOR of two number : which have set bits only at those places where A differs from B.  
So, after getting the **xor** `( a ^ b )` , we need to count the number of set bits.  
We can do that using **__builtin_popcount(i)**: This function is used to count the number of set bits in an integer.
XOR sets the bits that are different between `start` and `goal`, and unsets bits that are the same.

`__builtin_popcount(mask)` counts the `1`s in `mask`.

Example:

|Expression|Value|
|---|---|
|start|`0011010`|
|goal|`0101100`|
|start^goal|`0110110`|
|__builtin_popcount(start^goal)|4|
