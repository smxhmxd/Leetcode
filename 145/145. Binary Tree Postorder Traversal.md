## Solution

### Overview

To traverse a tree, we generally use two main strategies:

- Breadth-First Search (BFS):
    
    This approach involves scanning the tree level by level, starting from the top and moving downwards. Nodes at higher levels are visited before those at lower levels.
    
- Depth-First Search (DFS):
    
    In this method, the focus is on exploring as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. The traversal begins at the root, proceeds to a leaf, and then returns to the root to explore other branches.
    
    DFS can be further categorized into three types based on the order of visiting nodes relative to the root, left, and right nodes:
    
    - Preorder: Visit the root node first, then the left subtree, followed by the right subtree.
    - Inorder: Visit the left subtree first, then the root node, followed by the right subtree.
    - Postorder: Visit the left subtree first, then the right subtree, and finally the root node.

![Tree Traversal Example](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/Figures/145/traverse2.png)  
_Figure 1. Nodes are numbered in the order they are visited; refer to the sequence `1-2-3-4-5` to compare different traversal strategies._

For a binary tree with the root `[1, null, 2, 3]`, the tree structure is as follows:

```
1
 \
  2
 /
3
```

In Postorder traversal, nodes are visited in the sequence: `3` (left subtree), `2` (right subtree), and finally `1` (root). Thus, the output for this input should be `[3, 2, 1]`.

### Approach 1: Recursive Postorder Traversal

#### Intuition

![recursion](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/Figures/145/recursion.png)  
_Figure 2. Recursive DFS traversals._

The principle behind the recursive approach is that each node in the tree can be treated as the root of its own subtree. So, to perform a postorder traversal, we begin by recursively exploring the left child of the current node. If the left child is not `null`, we continue down the left side of the tree, processing all its children in the same manner. Once the left subtree has been fully traversed, we move to the right child of the current node and repeat the process. Finally, after both the left and right subtrees have been explored, we process the current node itself by adding its value to our result list.

The base case in this recursion is when the current node is `null`, which signifies that we have attempted to visit a leaf node's nonexistent child, indicating there is no further subtree to explore. At this point, we simply return without adding anything to our result and backtrack to the leaf node.

The beauty of this approach lies in its simplicity and direct alignment with the definition of postorder traversal. By allowing the call stack to manage the traversal order, we naturally achieve the desired sequence without needing to manually handle the traversal state.

#### Algorithm

1. Define a helper function `postorderTraversalHelper`:
    - If `currentNode` is `null`, return to stop further recursion.
    - Recursively call `postorderTraversalHelper` with `currentNode->left` to process the left subtree.
    - Recursively call `postorderTraversalHelper` with `currentNode->right` to process the right subtree.
    - Append `currentNode->val` to the `result` array to collect values in postorder.
2. In the `postorderTraversal` function:
    - Initialize an empty `result` array to store the postorder ordering of the nodes in`root`.
    - Call `postorderTraversalHelper` with the root node and `result` to start the traversal.
    - Return the `result` array containing the postorder traversal.

#### Implementation

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void postorderTraversalHelper(TreeNode* currentNode, vector<int>& result) {
        // Base case: if the node is null, return
        if (!currentNode) {
            return;
        }
        // Traverse left subtree
        postorderTraversalHelper(currentNode->left, result);
        // Traverse right subtree
        postorderTraversalHelper(currentNode->right, result);
        // Add the current node's value to the result list
        result.push_back(currentNode->val);
    }

    vector<int> postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> result;
        // Start traversal from root
        postorderTraversalHelper(root, result);
        return result;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of nodes.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    Each node is visited once during the traversal, so the time complexity is linear with respect to the number of nodes `n`.
    
- Space complexity: O(n)
    
    The space complexity is O(n) due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (e.g., a completely unbalanced tree), the recursion stack could hold all `n` nodes.

### Approach 2: Manipulating Preorder Traversal (Iterative Hack)

#### Intuition

Let's take a creative leap in this approach by exploiting the relationship between preorder and postorder traversals. In a standard preorder traversal, we visit the root node before we visit the left and right subtrees. However, postorder traversal requires us to visit the left and right subtrees before the root node.

What if we could slightly the the order of the left and right subtree visits in preorder traversal to help us find the postorder traversal? This leads us to the idea of a modified preorder traversal where we visit nodes in the order of root, right subtree, then left subtree, instead of the traditional root, left subtree, right subtree. If we then reverse the result list, we end up with the correct postorder sequence: left subtree, right subtree, root.

We initialize a stack to help us traverse the tree iteratively, starting with the root node. At each step, we push the current node onto the stack and add its value to the result list. But instead of moving to the left child (as we would in a normal preorder traversal), we move to the right child. If there is no right child, we pop a node from the stack and move to its left child. By doing this, we traverse the tree in a modified preorder manner that ensures the root and right subtrees are processed before the left subtree.

Once the entire tree has been traversed, the result list contains the node values in the order of root, right, left. To transform this into postorder, we simply reverse the list, giving us the correct left, right, root sequence.

The final reversal step is what ties everything together, transforming the order of visits into the desired postorder sequence.

#### Algorithm

1. Initialize an empty `result` list to store the traversal result, a `traversalStack` for nodes, and set `currentNode` to `root`.
2. While `currentNode` is not `null` or `traversalStack` is not empty:
    - If `currentNode` is not `null`, add `currentNode->val` to the `result` list before processing its children.
    - Push `currentNode` onto the `traversalStack` to revisit it later.
    - Move `currentNode` to `currentNode->right` to continue traversal in the right subtree.
    - If `currentNode` is `null`, pop the top node from `traversalStack` and set it to `currentNode`.
    - Move `currentNode` to `currentNode->left` to process the left subtree.
3. Reverse the `result` list to correct the order from preorder to postorder.
4. Return the `result` list with postorder traversal values.

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        // Vector to store the result of postorder traversal
        vector<int> result;
        // Stack to facilitate the traversal of nodes
        stack<TreeNode*> traversalStack;
        TreeNode* currentNode = root;

        // Traverse the tree while there are nodes to process
        while (currentNode != nullptr || !traversalStack.empty()) {
            if (currentNode != nullptr) {
                // Add current node's value to result list before going to its
                // children
                result.push_back(currentNode->val);
                // Push current node onto the stack
                traversalStack.push(currentNode);
                // Move to the right child
                currentNode = currentNode->right;
            } else {
                // Pop the node from the stack and move to its left child
                currentNode = traversalStack.top();
                traversalStack.pop();
                currentNode = currentNode->left;
            }
        }
        // Reverse the result list to get the correct postorder sequence
        reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
        return result;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of nodes.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    Each node is processed a constant number of times (essentially twice), so the time complexity remains linear with respect to `n`.
    
- Space complexity: O(2n)
    
    The space complexity is O(2n) due to the stack used for traversing the tree nodes. This stack could hold up to `n` nodes in the worst case.

### Approach 3: Two Stack Postorder Traversal (Iterative)

#### Intuition

Instead of relying on hacks and tricks, this time we will build on the idea that we need to control the order in which nodes are processed to achieve postorder traversal. Mimicking this behavior without recursion can be tricky. The idea of using two stacks comes from the need to control the traversal order in a systematic way.

We start by pushing the root node onto the first stack. This stack will simulate the recursive calls by storing nodes as we traverse the tree. However, to achieve postorder, where the root is processed last, we need a second stack. This second stack will help us reverse the order of processing.

As we pop nodes from the first stack, we push them onto the second stack. This reversal ensures that we process the right subtree before the left. Once all nodes are processed, the second stack contains the nodes in a reverse preorder sequence (root-right-left). When we pop nodes from the second stack, we effectively get them in postorder (left-right-root). This approach is both clever and efficient, allowing us to achieve the desired order by manipulating how we stack and unstack the nodes.

Finally, once the first stack is empty, the second stack contains the nodes in the correct postorder sequence. We simply pop them from the second stack and add their values to our result list.

This approach systematically handles the traversal order, ensuring that each node is processed in the correct sequence without requiring a final reversal step. The use of two stacks allows us to clearly separate the traversal logic from the result generation, making the method easy to follow and implement.

The two-stack method explicitly ensures that nodes are processed in the correct left-right-root order. The first stack is used to traverse the tree, while the second stack is used to reverse the order of processing to align with postorder traversal. Although it might initially seem like a manipulation of preorder traversal because of how the nodes are pushed, the final order achieved after popping from the second stack is postorder.

#### Algorithm

1. Initialize an empty `result` list, and create `mainStack` and `pathStack` for nodes.
2. Push `root` onto `mainStack` to start the traversal.
3. While `mainStack` is not empty:
    - Peek at the top of `mainStack` to examine the current node.
    - If the top of `pathStack` is the same as the top of `mainStack`, add `root->val` to the `result` list.
    - Pop the top node from both `mainStack` and `pathStack` after processing.
    - Otherwise, push the current node onto `pathStack`.
    - Push `root->right` and `root->left` onto `mainStack` if they exist to process their children.
4. Return the `result` list containing postorder traversal values.

#### Implementation

```cpp
// C++ implementation
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> result;

        // If the root is null, return an empty list
        if (!root) {
            return result;
        }

        // Stack to manage the traversal
        stack<TreeNode*> mainStack;
        // Stack to manage the path
        stack<TreeNode*> pathStack;

        // Start with the root node
        mainStack.push(root);

        // Process nodes until the main stack is empty
        while (!mainStack.empty()) {
            root = mainStack.top();

            // If the node is in the path stack and it's the top, add its value
            if (!pathStack.empty() && pathStack.top() == root) {
                result.push_back(root->val);
                mainStack.pop();
                pathStack.pop();
            } else {
                // Push the current node to the path stack
                pathStack.push(root);
                // Push right child if it exists
                if (root->right) {
                    mainStack.push(root->right);
                }
                // Push left child if it exists
                if (root->left) {
                    mainStack.push(root->left);
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of nodes.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    Each node is processed a constant number of times (once when pushed to the first stack and once when popped to the second stack), so the time complexity is linear with respect to `n`.
    
- Space complexity: O(n)
    
    The space complexity is O(n) due to the use of two stacks. Each stack can hold up to `n` nodes in the worst case.

### Approach 4: Single Stack Postorder Traversal (Iterative)

#### Intuition

After exploring the two-stack approach, we might start questioning whether it's possible to optimize our solution further by reducing the space complexity. The two stacks provide a clear and understandable way to control the order of traversal, but they also double our space usage. The insight here is that we might not need a second stack if we carefully manage the state of our traversal. This leads us to the idea of using a single stack, combined with a pointer say `previousNode`, to keep track of the traversal process.

We start by pushing nodes onto the stack as we traverse left down the tree, similar to how we would in an inorder traversal. However, the challenge in postorder traversal is that we must process each node only after its right subtree has been visited. To handle this, we use the `previousNode` pointer to remember the last node we processed. The `previousNode` pointer plays a crucial role in this, helping us remember the context of our traversal so that we process nodes at the correct time.

When we reach a node on the stack, we first check if it has a right child that hasn’t been visited yet. If it does, we move to that right child because we know we can’t process the current node until after its right subtree. If the node either has no right child or the right child has already been processed (which we know by checking if `previousNode` is that child), we then process the current node by popping it from the stack and adding its value to our result list. We also update `previousNode` to the current node, signaling that this node has been fully processed.

By just adding one pointer, we can track when to move to the right subtree and when to process the current node. As a result, we ensure the correct postorder sequence is achieved, all while using less space.

#### Algorithm

1. Initialize an empty `result` list, set `previousNode` to `null`, and initialize `traversalStack`.
2. While `root` is not `null` or `traversalStack` is not empty:
    - If `root` is not `null`, push `root` onto `traversalStack`.
    - Move `root` to `root->left` to process the left subtree.
    - If `root` is `null`, peek at the top of `traversalStack`.
    - If `root->right` is `null` or `root->right` equals `previousNode`, add `root->val` to `result`.
    - Pop `root` from `traversalStack`, set `previousNode` to `root`, and set `root` to `null`.
    - If `root->right` is not `null`, move `root` to `root->right` to continue traversal.
3. Return the `result` list containing postorder traversal values.

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> result;

        // If the root is null, return an empty list
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return result;
        }

        // To keep track of the previously processed node
        TreeNode* previousNode = nullptr;
        // Stack to manage the traversal
        stack<TreeNode*> traversalStack;

        // Process nodes until both the root is null and the stack is empty
        while (root != nullptr || !traversalStack.empty()) {
            // Traverse to the leftmost node
            if (root != nullptr) {
                traversalStack.push(root);
                root = root->left;
            } else {
                // Peek at the top node of the stack
                root = traversalStack.top();

                // If there is no right child or the right child was already
                // processed
                if (root->right == nullptr || root->right == previousNode) {
                    result.push_back(root->val);
                    traversalStack.pop();
                    previousNode = root;
                    root = nullptr;  // Ensure we don’t traverse again from this
                                     // node
                } else {
                    // Move to the right child
                    root = root->right;
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of nodes.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    Each node is processed a constant number of times. The stack operations and pointer manipulations also contribute to a linear time complexity with respect to `n`.
    
- Space complexity: O(n)
    
    Although this approach uses only a single stack, in the worst case, the stack can still hold up to `n` nodes, so the space complexity remains O(n). However, this approach optimizes the space usage compared to using two stacks.

### Approach 5: Morris Traversal (No stack)

#### Intuition

All the approaches so far have been using some auxiliary space. To optimize for space complexity, we can use a traversal algorithm called Morris traversal. In Morris traversal, the tree structure is temporarily modified to create temporary links that simulate the effect of a stack or recursion. As a result, there is no overhead from additional data structures and the space complexity is constant. This traversal is tricky to understand at first, but the high level idea is to link each predecessor back to the current node , which allows us to trace back to the top of the tree. We encourage you to simulate the traversal on a piece of paper to get a stronger understanding.

In setting up of Morris traversal, we introduce a `dummyNode` with a value that is not part of the original tree and link it to the root. This dummy node simplifies the handling of edge cases and ensures a uniform traversal process. Our traversal begins with this dummyNode, treating it as the new root of the tree.

For each node, we look for its in-order predecessor, the rightmost node in its left subtree. We do this so that the in-order predecessor can be used to create a temporary link back to the current node, simulating the recursive call stack.

- If the current node has a left child, we find the rightmost node in the left subtree. This rightmost node is the in-order predecessor.
- We then create a temporary link from this predecessor to the current node by setting its right pointer to the current node.

If the predecessor's right pointer is `null`, we set it to point to the current node and move to the left child of the current node. This step effectively simulates the recursive call by allowing us to return to the current node after processing the left subtree.

When we encounter a node whose predecessor’s right pointer already points back to the current node, it indicates that the left subtree has been fully processed. At this point, we process the current node and then reverse the temporary link to restore the tree’s original structure.

After processing the node, we move to the right child and continue the traversal.

To maintain the tree’s original structure, we reverse the temporary links we created. This involves resetting the right pointers of the nodes in the left subtree to null, ensuring that the tree remains unchanged for subsequent operations.

It may initially seem unintuitive that Morris traversal is O(n), given that finding the predecessor is often O(logn). However, finding the predecessor does not have be done for every node, only for nodes with a valid left child.

> Note: Morris traversal could come up in an interview, but it's not a guaranteed topic. Think of it as a potential curveball—useful to know, but not always the main focus. It’s like a surprise feature on a gadget—nice to have if needed, but not always essential. Know it, but focus on the basics to be safe.

#### Algorithm

1. Initialize an empty `result` list and create a dummy node with value `-1`. Set `dummyNode->left` to `root` and update `root` to `dummyNode`.
2. While `root` is not `null`:
    - If `root->left` is not `null`, find the rightmost node (predecessor) in `root->left` subtree.
    - If the right child of the predecessor is `null`, set the right child to `root` and move `root` to `root->left`.
    - If the right child of the predecessor is `root`, perform reverse traversal of `root->left` subtree and add values to `result`.
    - Reverse the subtree back to its original state by restoring pointers.
    - Remove the temporary link from the predecessor to `root` and move `root` to `root->right`.
    - If `root->left` is `null`, move `root` to `root->right`.
3. Return the `result` list containing postorder traversal values.

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> result;

        // If the root is null, return an empty list
        if (root == NULL) {
            return result;
        }

        // Create a dummy node to simplify edge cases
        TreeNode dummy = -1;
        TreeNode* dummyNode = &dummy;
        TreeNode* predecessor = NULL;
        dummyNode->left = root;
        root = dummyNode;

        // Traverse the tree
        while (root != NULL) {
            // If the current node has a left child
            if (root->left != NULL) {
                predecessor = root->left;

                // Find the rightmost node in the left subtree or the thread
                // back to the current node
                while (predecessor->right != NULL &&
                       predecessor->right != root) {
                    predecessor = predecessor->right;
                }

                // Create a thread if it doesn't exist
                if (predecessor->right == NULL) {
                    predecessor->right = root;
                    root = root->left;
                } else {
                    // Process the nodes in the left subtree
                    TreeNode* node = predecessor;
                    reverseSubtreeLinks(root->left, predecessor);

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the number of nodes.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    Each node is visited a constant number of times, and the traversal through the tree is linear in terms of `n`.
    
- Space complexity: O(1)
    
    The Morris Traversal technique uses no extra space beyond the pointers used for traversal. The temporary modifications to the tree structure are reversed before the traversal ends, so the space complexity is constant.
