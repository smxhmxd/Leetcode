### Description

A **critical point** in a linked list is defined as **either** a **local maxima** or a **local minima**.

A node is a **local maxima** if the current node has a value **strictly greater** than the previous node and the next node.

A node is a **local minima** if the current node has a value **strictly smaller** than the previous node and the next node.

Note that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists **both** a previous node and a next node.

Given a linked list `head`, return _an array of length 2 containing_ `[minDistance, maxDistance]` _where_ `minDistance` _is the **minimum distance** between **any two distinct** critical points and_ `maxDistance` _is the **maximum distance** between **any two distinct** critical points. If there are **fewer** than two critical points, return_ `[-1, -1]`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/13/a1.png)

**Input:** head = [3,1]
**Output:** [-1,-1]
**Explanation:** There are no critical points in [3,1].

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/13/a2.png)

**Input:** head = [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]
**Output:** [1,3]
**Explanation:** There are three critical points:
- [5,3,**1**,2,5,1,2]: The third node is a local minima because 1 is less than 3 and 2.
- [5,3,1,2,**5**,1,2]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 5 is greater than 2 and 1.
- [5,3,1,2,5,**1**,2]: The sixth node is a local minima because 1 is less than 5 and 2.
The minimum distance is between the fifth and the sixth node. minDistance = 6 - 5 = 1.
The maximum distance is between the third and the sixth node. maxDistance = 6 - 3 = 3.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/14/a5.png)

**Input:** head = [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]
**Output:** [3,3]
**Explanation:** There are two critical points:
- [1,**3**,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The second node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 1 and 2.
- [1,3,2,2,**3**,2,2,2,7]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 2 and 2.
Both the minimum and maximum distances are between the second and the fifth node.
Thus, minDistance and maxDistance is 5 - 2 = 3.
Note that the last node is not considered a local maxima because it does not have a next node.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

## Solution

### Approach: One Pass

#### Intuition

The problem requires finding the minimum and maximum distances between any two distinct critical points (local maxima or minima) in a given linked list. For example, consider the following list:

![Image_1](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-and-maximum-number-of-nodes-between-critical-points/Figures/2058/image_1.png)

The critical points for this list are:

![Image_2](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-and-maximum-number-of-nodes-between-critical-points/Figures/2058/image_2.png)

Notice that:

1. The two critical points farthest away from each other are the ones at the beginning and the end of the list.
2. The minimum distance would always lie between any two consecutive critical points.

![Image_3](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-and-maximum-number-of-nodes-between-critical-points/Figures/2058/image_3.png)

Now, the problem is reduced to identifying all the critical points in the linked list and continuously tracking the minimum distance between any two consecutive critical points. We must also note the first and last critical points encountered to calculate the maximum distance.

Let us traverse the linked list from its head. We will need to keep track of 6 things:

1. **The current node**: to iterate over the list
2. **The previous node**: to compare its value with the current node
3. **Position of the current node**: to calculate the distance in case it's a critical point
4. **Position of the previous critical point**: to calculate the distance from the next critical point
5. **Position of the first critical point**: to calculate the maximum distance
6. **Minimum distance**: to update the minimum distance for each pair of consecutive critical points

As we move through the list, encountering a critical point prompts us to update the minimum distance with the difference between the current node's position and the previous critical point. When we encounter the first critical point, we note its position and later subtract it from the position of the last critical point to find the maximum distance.

> Note: We can start the traversal from the second node and end at the second last node because, according to our problem definition, critical points require both a previous and a next node, which the first and last nodes lack.

#### Algorithm

- Initialize:
    - The `result` array to `[-1, -1]`, in case there is no valid solution.
    - `minDistance` to the maximum permissible integer value.
    - `previousNode` to point at `head`.
    - `currentNode` to point at the next node from `head`.
    - `currentIndex` storing the position of `currentNode`.
    - `previousCriticalIndex` and `firstCriticalIndex` set to 0.
- Loop over the list till the second-last element:
    - If the current node is a critical point:
        - If it is the first critical point encountered:
            - Set `previousCriticalIndex` and `firstCriticalIndex` to the position of the current node.
        - Else, update `minDistance` as the minimum of the current `minDistance` and difference between `currentIndex` and `previousCriticalIndex`.
    - Increment `currentIndex`. Move `previousNode` to the current node and `currentNode` to the next node in the list.
- If `minDistance` is not equal to its initial value:
    - Set `maxDistance` to the difference between `previousCriticalIndex` and `firstCriticalIndex`.
    - Update `result` with `minDistance` and `maxDistance`.
- Return `result`.

#### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> nodesBetweenCriticalPoints(ListNode* head) {
        vector<int> result = {-1, -1};

        // Initialize minimum distance to the maximum possible value
        int minDistance = INT_MAX;

        // Pointers to track the previous node, current node, and indices
        ListNode* previousNode = head;
        ListNode* currentNode = head->next;
        int currentIndex = 1;
        int previousCriticalIndex = 0;
        int firstCriticalIndex = 0;

        while (currentNode->next != nullptr) {
            // Check if the current node is a local maxima or minima
            if ((currentNode->val < previousNode->val &&
                 currentNode->val < currentNode->next->val) ||
                (currentNode->val > previousNode->val &&
                 currentNode->val > currentNode->next->val)) {
                // If this is the first critical point found
                if (previousCriticalIndex == 0) {
                    previousCriticalIndex = currentIndex;
                    firstCriticalIndex = currentIndex;
                } else {
                    // Calculate the minimum distance between critical points
                    minDistance =
                        min(minDistance, currentIndex - previousCriticalIndex);
                    previousCriticalIndex = currentIndex;
                }
            }

            // Move to the next node and update indices
            currentIndex++;
            previousNode = currentNode;
            currentNode = currentNode->next;
        }

        // If at least two critical points were found
        if (minDistance != INT_MAX) {
            int maxDistance = previousCriticalIndex - firstCriticalIndex;
            result = {minDistance, maxDistance};
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the the length of the linked list.

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
    The algorithm traverses the list only once, making the time complexity O(n).
    
- Space complexity: O(1)
    
    The algorithm has a constant space complexity since it does not utilize any additional data structures.
